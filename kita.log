00:26:31Irssi: Starting query in esper with Kita
00:26:31<Kita> The big problem comes from when people begin to replace facts with spiritualist fiction... Typical in the realms of morality or medicine.
00:28:37<Laevos> It's a complicated issue in some parts of the world. I'd say that statement certainly holds true in the US (though most of the problems come from the Abrahamic religions as far as I've seen, which seem to be more dogmatic than rightly spiritual)
00:30:46<Kita> The idea is still the same... For the sake of comfort they discard reality.
00:30:58<Laevos> But yes, speaking in terms of the first world, especially the US, those who call themselves spiritual, or religious, often work very fervently against progress
00:31:19<Kita> It isn't that Kita is stating that they are against progress...
00:31:45<Laevos> Well, when you talk about the other parts of the world you have to take into account the soverignty of indeginous peoples and the very specific ways that 'truth' can be employed by imperialist regimes
00:32:04<Laevos> No, you didn't say that, but it is true
00:32:15<Kita> Only that their denial of what is real, so they can seek what is comfortable, and the pressing of that on individuals without good deductive reasoning, causes people to let horrible things happen to themselves.
00:32:50<Laevos> Yeah, as well as the hinderance of such causes as women's reproductive rights, soverignty over their bodies, etc.
00:33:25<Kita> Kita is a seeker of truth, not a seeker of comfort.
00:33:31<Kita> The world does not owe her comfort.
00:33:42<Kita> The world owes Kita nothing.
00:34:20<Kita> The world is a metaphysical concept that attempts to describe the daily coincidences that make up what Kita will experience in her life.
00:34:31<Kita> It has no feelings or wants or obligations.
00:34:50<Kita> It is a way of describing something that she wants to talk about.
00:35:00<Laevos> The world is?
00:35:02<Kita> Yes.
00:35:15<Laevos> Okay, just clarifying the referant
00:36:31<Laevos> Anyway, as long as that's the direction of the subject, I'd consider the natural world to be that apathetic entity that you describe
00:36:59<Laevos> but I do think that the political world that we as humans have created should work to ensure the basic comfort of its inhabitants, at the very least
00:37:28<Kita> Minimise potential and actual suffering; maximise potential and actual happiness?
00:38:03<Laevos> I wouldn't put it in such utilitarian terms, hehe :P
00:38:36<Laevos> Equity and justice are of far greater concern for me
00:38:37 Kita: likes that phrasing...
00:38:57<Kita> Wouldn't equity and justice be an example of minimising suffering?
00:39:09<Laevos> Depends
00:39:26<Laevos> If we're talking about net suffering or happines, almost assuredly not
00:40:11 Kita: tilts her head.
00:40:14<Kita> Explain?
00:40:23<Laevos> I don't really believe in a utopia of any kind
00:40:31<Laevos> I believe in trying to make the world as good as it can be
00:40:34<Laevos> and I'm certainly an idealist
00:40:47<Laevos> but I do not believe that all of my ideals are things that will be achieved by humans
00:41:05<Laevos> and
00:41:33<Laevos> currently I find that some of the more privileged members of humanity enjoy a standard of living that relies in part or in whole on the exploitation of others
00:41:57<Laevos> liberating the exploited of that state then necessitates a reduction in the standard of living of the privileged
00:42:08<Kita> It isn't about being utopian. It is about getting as close as possible. It's like a limit.
00:42:11<Laevos> in those cases where its extent relies so wholly on that very exploitation
00:42:21<Laevos> Exactly
00:42:41<Kita> You can always get better.
00:42:42<Laevos> the point of the above was to say that I don't believe that everyone can live like, say, a billionare
00:42:54<Laevos> therefore I do not believe that the goal should be to make everyone a billionare, in this example
00:43:12<Kita> A disproportionate society is inferior to a society where everyone is mostly content.
00:43:34<Laevos> I'd say so too
00:44:40<Laevos> that's why I'm wary of utilitarian phrasings, because I've run into a whole lot of adherents to utility whose morality allows for such disparity when it results in a "net gain" by their standards
00:44:41<Kita> However, tell this to people and they would scream "SERSHALERSIM"
00:45:05<Kita> Oh. That utilitarian statement is order sensitive.
00:45:27<Kita> The phrase "minimise potential and actual suffering" comes first because that is what should be done first.
00:45:36<Laevos> Okay
00:45:59<Kita> The phrase "maximise potential and actual happiness" comes second because it should come second, and not at the expense of the first phrase.
00:46:10<Laevos> I can jive with that, then
00:46:29<Kita> It is the basis for a secular, objective reality.
00:46:31<Kita> Er
00:46:34<Kita> morality*
00:46:37<Kita> Not reality.
00:46:38<Kita> >>
00:46:51<Laevos> Hehehe
00:46:57<Kita> That might be a sign of tiredness, or schizo meds.
00:47:00<Laevos> I'm not at all interested in an objective reality
00:47:02<Laevos> awwww
00:47:21<Kita> Yes.
00:47:47<Kita> You are discussing morality/objective reasoning with a hardcore schizophrenic.
00:48:06<Kita> It's like a 14 drug cocktail that allows Kita to even function.
00:48:27<Kita> And EVEN THEN... She must be observed, tested, and contained...
00:48:33<Kita> Regardless of her functionality.
00:48:51<Laevos> I'm going to to assume that the media depictions thereof are inaccurate and that I know absolutely nothing about any kind of schizophrenic affectivity
00:49:08<Laevos> that does sound very trying, though
00:49:17<Laevos> ...to say the least x_x
00:49:39<Kita> Well
00:49:55<Laevos> but I suppose you wouldn't do it if it weren't better than the alternative?
00:49:58<Kita> Withut these medications... Kita is a crippled, babbling, irrational, violent nutjob.
00:49:59<Laevos> Assuming you were given any choice in the matter
00:50:06<Kita> Without*
00:50:39<Kita> The Kita speaking now exists without the medications... but she is trapped behind soundproof glass, watching as something else destroys everything around her.
00:51:09<Laevos> Understood. I'm glad that the Kita with which I am currently speaking has been provided with the means to do so
00:51:36<Kita> Eventually that other thing loses its ability to coherently do things and just attacks anything around it... it was originally a slow degeneration... A happy child being trapped in her own body by some violent monster.
00:52:33<Kita> Schizophrenia is terrifying.
00:52:44<Kita> Most don't regain high function with medication.
00:52:49 Kita: is a rare success.
00:52:59<Kita> A sadly rare success.
00:53:07<Laevos> We cannot begin to comprehend the depths of terror which your words hint at
00:53:21<Laevos> we're glad that it was successful in your case, but saddened that it's such a rarity...
00:56:15<Laevos> also a bit humbled to have been given such information, thank you.
00:56:27<Kita> Kita also self-medicates her fear and sadness with food. Food is comforting. Food is real.
00:57:04<Laevos> I'm the opposite. I seem to deal with the lack of control I sometimes feel over my mind with a rigid domination over what I ingest
00:57:21<Laevos> but that's perfectly understandable
00:57:24<Laevos> food is quite real
00:57:41<Kita> Kita has a rigid domination over what she ingests.
00:58:03<Kita> It belongs in her stomach, and she dominates it by eating it.
00:58:08<Laevos> :D
00:58:27 Kita: nibbles on lemon pudding.
00:58:33<Laevos> That sounds pretty yummy
00:58:38<Kita> It is yummy.
00:58:44<Kita> Slightly sour.
00:58:46<Laevos> Most of my meals of late have been dry oatmeal and black beans
00:58:47<Kita> Just a little.
00:58:52<Laevos> I adore sour
00:58:52<Kita> That sounds...
00:59:00<Kita> Kind of not fun.
00:59:11<Laevos> I don't really have much of an attachment to food, really
00:59:15<Laevos> honestly I kind of hate eating
00:59:19 Kita: enjoys her access to a wide, varied palette of flavours.
00:59:20<Laevos> especially if it results in me being full
00:59:36<Kita> It almost becomes sensual.
00:59:52<Laevos> That's good
01:00:15<Kita> Nah. It is probably a sexualised eating disorder.
01:00:17 Kita: chuckles.
01:00:21<Laevos> Maybe
01:00:30<Kita> Even under medications to make her rational, Kita is still irrational.
01:01:07<Laevos> I'd say that even if it could be classified as such, enjoying things is... good
01:01:23<Laevos> necessary, I'd extend it to, even.
01:01:50 Kita: enjoys video games.
01:01:51<Kita> n.n
01:01:54<Kita> Which is good
01:01:56<Laevos> Good!
01:02:01<Kita> Kita is home...
01:02:03<Kita> A lot.
01:02:06<Kita> All the time
01:02:14<Kita> Never allowed to leave unsupervised.
01:02:23<Kita> Not allowed to have a job.
01:02:40<Laevos> May I ask what Kita's living conditions currently consist of?
01:02:54<Kita> Good thing Adoptive Brother is fucking loaded, or else Kita would be S.O.L.
01:03:03<Laevos> Ah, okay
01:03:08<Laevos> that is a very good thing, then
01:03:16 Kita: does not live off government handout.
01:03:25 Kita: lives on familial handout.
01:04:27<Laevos> The idea of the 'welfare leech' is one loaded with all sorts of biases
01:05:03<Laevos> and a rather intense lack of humanity, it seems to me...
01:05:05<Kita> Sure
01:05:24<Kita> And even if Kita lived off government handout, she has a legitimate reason...
01:05:29<Laevos> Indeed
01:05:45<Kita> But Kita is happy to only be a burden on one, and one who actively chose to shoulder it, as well.
01:05:57<Kita> He could have let the government have it...
01:06:08<Laevos> I'm glad that you're provided for, at any rate
01:07:01<Kita> But he basically went, "No. She is my sister. She is intelligent, fun, and loving. She deserves the care I can provide. I will provide it, not because she needs me to, but because I want to, to return to her the happiness she gives me."
01:07:11<Kita> And that is how Kita was released from asylum.
01:07:16<Laevos> Awww
01:07:29<Kita> Big, muscly German dude.
01:07:50<Kita> Went drinking once, in Oregon with friends, and punched an elk.
01:07:57<Laevos> o_o
01:07:58<Laevos> Well then
01:08:06<Kita> Well, it was in their camp
01:08:09<Kita> And making a mess
01:08:13<Laevos> Okay xD
01:08:16<Kita> And kind of being violent.
01:08:26<Laevos> Yeah the context for that helped
01:08:28<Kita> So he punched it so hard that its skull fractured.
01:08:35<Laevos> x_x
01:08:51<Kita> And he brought home butcher-processed elk.
01:08:56 Kita: grins.
01:08:59<Laevos> Was it yummy?
01:09:06<Kita> And this fox lurved it.
01:09:10<Laevos> Hehehe xD
01:10:00<Laevos> He sounds like a nice person
01:10:36<Kita> He is
01:11:19<Kita> He also takes Kita to the local dispensary twice a week so that she gets some social interaction.
01:11:28<Laevos> Good!
01:11:35<Laevos> How does that usually go?
01:11:40<Kita> They think Kita is super cute, with her velvet cloak and parasol.
01:11:46<Kita> (Albinism)
01:12:17<Laevos> Yeah, I remember you telling me about that condition, at least
01:12:38<Kita> And they like Kiv, a lot. So they typically take us to the back and smoke us up with their experimental strands.
01:12:55<Laevos> Is Kiv your brother?
01:14:07<Kita> Legally, yes!
01:14:16 Kita: was adopted.
01:14:48<Laevos> Yeah, sorry :P I figured if you consider him your brother it'd be a little uncouth of me to always preface it with "adopted-"
01:15:42<Laevos> Was Kita adopted at a very young age?
01:17:00<Kita> Is 6 young?
01:17:23 Kita: spent time in a Catholic funded orphanage...
01:17:26<Laevos> I'd hazard a guess at old enough to perhaps have some memories before that
01:17:39<Laevos> I'm very sorry to hear that.
01:17:43<Kita> The orphanage was poor.
01:17:49<Kita> But they didn't hurt Kita.
01:17:57<Laevos> That's good, at least...
01:18:18<Kita> They took a lot of pictures of her, and one time did so many in one day that it gave her skin a burn.
01:18:33<Kita> They REALLY pushed getting Kita out.
01:18:55<Laevos> Oh my...
01:18:59<Kita> No one wanted the creepy, mismatched eyes, albino Satanspawn girl.
01:19:10<Kita> So they just straight up advertised her.
01:19:57<Laevos> I'm glad that you seem to have been found by a caring family
01:20:37<Kita> Kiv took care of Kita, mostly.
01:20:50<Laevos> A family with a caring brother, then
01:21:03<Kita> Family was nice, but distant... except for Kiv's sister...
01:21:11<Kita> Who was a bitch and picked on Kita.
01:21:14<Laevos> mew
01:22:13<Laevos> That's unfortunate... Guessing she's no longer in the picture?
01:24:06<Kita> Kita was disowned by the family, and Kiv was the only to fight for Kita...
01:24:30<Kita> Kiv was disowned because he called everyone out on being awful people.
01:24:41<Laevos> Jeez x_x
01:25:15<Laevos> He sounds like an amazing person. <3 
01:25:15<Kita> Kita would pretend to be dumb in the asylum, so she could hear the honesty of her family.
01:25:28<Kita> Kiv knew Kita wasn't dumb.
01:25:40<Kita> Father said really bad things to Kita.
01:25:47<Laevos> That's horrible...
01:26:18<Kita> Said that if she were still conscious, she should feel horrible for doing this to the family, and that she was supposed to stay in the asylum, locked up and forgotten.
01:26:38<Kita> A transaction at the end of every month disguised as a car payment.
01:27:11<Laevos> That's disgusting...
01:30:47 Laevos: sighs..
01:31:06<Kita> So yeah
01:31:08<Kita> Noshame
01:31:27<Laevos> It's enough to make us dizzy... glad that you came out of everything alive
01:31:29<Kita> And Pepper didn't laugh at the Circle Jerk.
01:31:30<Kita> :<
01:31:35<Laevos> I thought it was funny ;n;
01:31:38<Laevos> Did you make it? o:
01:31:43<Kita> Yes.
01:31:44<Kita> o.
01:31:46<Kita> oo
01:31:48<Kita> Like
01:31:51<Kita> Right then
01:31:56<Laevos> Yeah, I thought so
01:31:58<Kita> Less than two minutes to make it.
01:32:00<Laevos> it was great really
01:32:09 Kita: does other things, too.
01:32:26<Laevos> Such as?
01:32:30<Kita> Like photoshop googly eyes on fat chick furries.
01:32:38<Laevos> omg
01:32:52<Laevos> Googly eyes are probably...
01:32:56<Laevos> the pinnacle of civilization
01:33:06<Kita> http://imgur.com/vktUfZy
01:33:37<Laevos> xD
01:34:04<Kita> And
01:34:08<Kita> This one isn't Furry
01:34:13<Kita> But Kita did this one, too.
01:34:15<Kita> http://imgur.com/4OCfuUJ
01:34:39<Laevos> Side effects of tentacles may include...
01:35:17<Laevos> I think you've greatly improved them
01:35:36<Kita> http://imgur.com/RqTt892
01:36:11<Laevos> The rosy complexion, that come-hither gaze...
01:36:12<Laevos> Hahaha xD
01:37:05 Kita: has a hard time finding good pictures to googly
01:37:15<Kita> Like... it has to be good quality art
01:37:21<Laevos> Sure
01:37:25<Kita> and
01:37:32<Kita> You have to be able to see the eyes
01:37:50<Kita> and glasses are okay, but only if they cover the entire eye.
01:38:08<Laevos> That makes sense
01:38:49<Kita> Basically
01:39:02<Kita> Kita goes through her porn folder until she finds something googlyable.
01:39:39<Laevos> Truly it's an art in and of itself
01:39:48<Kita> of course
01:43:32<Kita> Seriously though
01:43:44<Laevos> ?
01:43:45<Kita> Fat is one of the hardest fetishes to find decent art for.
01:43:52<Laevos> I don't doubt it
01:44:11 Kita: just wants vanilla fat. Doesn't need slob, doesn't need giant feet, doesn't need to 20 feet tall...
01:44:42<Laevos> Yeah, it seems like in some cases it'd be easier to find things with a panoply of fetishes in them than one that just narrows it down to one
01:45:21<Kita> Most fat artists do art the quality of mistystuffer and BingFox.
01:45:31<Laevos> I dunno who those beings are
01:45:41<Kita> A simple Google search
01:45:48<Kita> And you will be horrified.
01:46:20<Laevos> Fiiine
01:46:22<Laevos> Oh okay
01:46:41<Kita> But then you have artists like Deonwolf, who do great art... but are ALWAYS drawing HYPR, herms, and 'taurs.
01:47:30<Laevos> HYPR?
01:47:43<Kita> And the rest of them are like Kinkshamer, who nuke their galleries at the slightest transgression.
01:47:58<Kita> Like, giant, firm tits and enormous cockandballs.
01:48:13<Laevos> Oh, okay
01:48:24<Kita> Ridiculous proportion sexual features, basically.
01:48:37<Laevos> Gotcha
01:49:16<Laevos> I'm very vanilla... nowadays pretty much the only porn I look at is of my partner
01:49:48 Kita: has partners, but isn't very committed due to lack of any physical sensations. T^T
01:50:19<Laevos> Because of distance, or?
01:51:56<Kita> Because of her, essential, quarantine.
01:52:08<Laevos> Yeah :/
01:52:12<Kita> Like
01:52:17<Kita> People could be here...
01:52:25<Kita> But TECHNICALLY it isn't safe
01:52:34<Kita> And that turns a lot of people away
01:52:46<Kita> And Kita needs a level of physical intimacy.
01:52:52<Laevos> That's very understandable
01:52:52<Kita> Also..
01:52:59<Laevos> needing physical intimacy, I mean
01:53:09<Kita> The Kita doesn't have sex like regular people.
01:53:19<Kita> Her fetish has become rather extreme.
01:53:25<Laevos> What fetish is that?
01:53:42 Kita: points to the pictures she has googlied.
01:54:08<Kita> Kita doesn't get off on getting penetrated or fingered or anything like that.
01:54:21<Kita> What gets Kita off is when she can feed another girl.
01:54:27<Laevos> Oh okay
01:54:41<Kita> Preferably, enough to fatten them up.
01:55:26<Kita> Kita has also found that she has no upper limit.
01:55:30<Kita> There is no cap
01:55:35<Laevos> Yeah :c Hopefully Kita can find people who are also into that
01:55:41<Kita> Hah
01:55:47<Laevos> like
01:55:53<Laevos> that would be able to go to the Kita
01:56:09<Kita> They are all fucking straight, and want conventional sex, which Kita cannot deliver..
01:56:21<Laevos> mew
01:56:24<Laevos> I'm sorry...
01:56:39<Kita> It's awful. <3
01:56:59<Laevos> It sounds like it...
01:57:35<Laevos> That makes me sad, people deserve somebody with which they can be intimate in a way that's mutally enjoyed, especially when they're awesome people xnx
01:58:59<Kita> Even if Kita found someone...
01:59:16<Kita> Kita would eventually end up fattening them to death.
01:59:28<Kita> T^T
02:00:48<Laevos> I'm sure there's a way... to strike a balance or... to find some way of working it out ;~;
02:04:28<Laevos> Sorry... getting this tired makes me even more openly emotional
02:04:51 Kita: petpats.
02:05:00<Kita> Then maybe it is time for you to bed.
02:05:03<Laevos> Maybe
02:05:05<Laevos> I should get a shower
02:05:11<Laevos> I'm just sad now
02:05:18<Laevos> moving seems like too much of an exacerbation
02:05:41<Kita> Kita will smack Laevos on the ass, if that provides any encouragement.
02:06:14 Laevos: will never be a girl
02:06:25<Kita> Sowhat
02:06:33<Kita> Also
02:06:38<Kita> You could if you wanted to
02:06:58<Laevos> thought about it
02:07:13<Laevos> my partner did it and it worked very well for her
02:07:21<Kita> Good!
02:07:28<Laevos> but I gave up
02:07:51<Laevos> on me
02:07:56<Kita> :<
02:08:10<Kita> Do you feel you are female in identity?
02:08:19<Laevos> sometimes
02:08:26<Laevos> sometimes I don't feel like I have any identity at all
02:08:33<Laevos> tried wearing makeup
02:08:43<Laevos> liked doing it, didn't like looking at my face while it was on
02:09:04<Kita> It probably only exaggerated the lack of feminine features?
02:09:42<Laevos> http://imgur.com/a/473rF this was from when my partner was here and tried styling my  hair and giving me lipstick
02:10:16<Kita> You're lucky
02:10:55<Laevos> In many ways,  yes, but what're you referring to?
02:11:30<Kita> If you wanted to be female
02:11:48<Kita> The high cheekbones and pointed chin are more effeminate features.
02:12:45<Laevos> I feel like my life's so busy that... I wouldn't be able to do enough to make it, I'd get stuck half-way
02:13:01<Kita> You could do it.
02:13:02<Kita> 3
02:13:06<Kita> <3*
02:13:23<Laevos> Am crying now.
02:14:13<Kita> :<
02:14:15<Laevos> Maybe my partner would stay, it's my masculine features that she likes though, she's explicated
02:14:49 Kita: has firm belief that gender dysphoria should be treated with a level of transition that the person feels comfortable with.
02:15:26<Laevos> yeah
02:15:26 Kita: knows quite a few trans woman, and a handful of trans men, and in beginning transition, they become much happier.
02:15:42<Laevos> feeling life-dysphoric
02:15:58 Kita: petpats.
02:16:02<Laevos> sorry
02:16:09<Kita> It is okay to feel uncomfortable.
02:16:24<Kita> In fact, it is human to feel uncomfortable or scared or a bunch of other things.
02:17:15<Laevos> can't afford it, anyway
02:17:46<Laevos> and if I do something that ends up making my dad disown me, I won't even be able to afford finishing school
02:18:07<Kita> Become secure in life first, then seek treatment.
02:18:09<Kita> <3
02:18:28<Laevos> My hair's getting thinner
02:18:37<Laevos> I take prenatals every day to try and keep it healthy
02:19:34 Kita: is super emotionally attached to her hair... Growing it out as long as she can, cutting only the split ends.
02:19:44 Laevos: nods'
02:20:19<Laevos> the fact that it's likely that I'll lose mine tears me apart sometimes
02:21:03<Kita> Look into a vitamin K supplement.
02:21:33<Laevos> I'm sorry for dumping all of this on you
02:23:45<Kita> Is okay
02:24:12 Kita: is typically listening to fetishists gush, in an attempt to dissect the causes of fetishism.
02:24:18<Kita> Also
02:24:40<Kita> Fetishism seems to be a genetic/brain structure thing, not a trauma or exposure thing
02:24:46<Kita> Nature, not nuture.
02:24:55<Laevos> Huh
02:25:13<Laevos> guess it stands to reason
02:25:38<Kita> It is interesting.
02:25:57<Kita> Kinks seem to be developed through exposure.
02:26:41<Laevos> Hmm
02:26:52<Laevos> I think I have a kink for kissing, that's about it
02:26:57 Laevos: vanilla bean
02:27:08 Kita: petpats.
02:27:14<Kita> Better than Kita.
02:27:30<Kita> Female sex parts don't seem to trigger right.
02:27:30<Kita> X3
02:28:18<Laevos> I'm sorry... I really do hope you'll find somebody
02:28:27<Laevos> if you want to, that is
02:28:47 Kita: rubs Laevos' nose.
02:30:10<Laevos> A lot of very cool people have quite extensive fetishes. The kinds of people I'm usually drawn to. Have nothing to offer in return though, guess I like pleasuring my partners in whatever way they enjoy
02:30:19<Laevos> I dunno
02:30:46<Kita> Or
02:31:15<Kita> Maybe Laevos just lacks the genetic codifiers for brain structures that result in fetishism by coincidence.
02:31:30<Laevos> quite possibly
02:31:42<Kita> Which would make sense.
02:31:53<Kita> Fetishism makes people more picky about their partners.
02:32:02<Laevos> but I don't think that way... that is... I don't concieve of myself as genetics, even though I know it is
02:32:08<Laevos> so I still feel guilt over things I have no control over
02:32:53<Kita> Even funnier... Certain physics theories support multiverses.
02:33:25<Laevos> yeah
02:33:59<Kita> Technically, this would mean that there is no free will, as where there is anything resembling probability, all options are chosen, multiple times, which means you never had a choice of which timeline you'd be in
02:34:39<Laevos> not gonna sugar-coat it
02:34:41<Laevos> that made me feel
02:34:43<Laevos> so much worse
02:34:58<Kita> Lack of control, right?
02:35:04<Laevos> yeah
02:35:31<Kita> So... Do you have an compulsive or obsessive tendencies?
02:35:39<Laevos> I have no idea
02:35:54<Kita> You certainly have a fear of infinity.
02:36:10<Laevos> I like to highlight blocks of text as I'm reading and move it around
02:36:12<Laevos> in browsers
02:36:24<Laevos> highlighting and highlighting
02:36:42<Laevos> doubt that counts
02:36:57<Kita> Do you feel like you could stop yourself from doing it?
02:37:03<Laevos> no
02:37:21<Kita> That is probably a compulsive tendency
02:38:05<Kita> OCT (Obsessive/Compulsive Tendencies) are common in people who fear infinity.
02:38:26<Laevos> sometimes I can't stop thinking about dying
02:38:31<Laevos> and am just paralyzed
02:38:46<Kita> Wanna hear something nice about dying?
02:38:56<Laevos> go ahead
02:39:07<Kita> Every bad thought you've ever had goes away.
02:39:33<Laevos> ow
02:39:40<Kita> Any time you've ever thought about a bad thing, that could never happen again.
02:39:56<Kita> Bad thoughts would be gone.
02:40:01 Kita: finds that peaceful.
02:40:10<Laevos> I'm glad it comforts you
02:40:39<Kita> Death is the end.
02:40:45<Kita> Everything dies.
02:40:49<Laevos> yes
02:41:08<Kita> But, we get to experience this specific piece of things before we die.
02:41:17<Kita> No one will ever have the same experience.
02:42:00<Laevos> maybe I should just get it over with
02:42:09<Laevos> but I know I won't
02:42:13<Kita> Oh no. That is a bad idea.
02:42:26<Kita> Then you would miss out on the good thoughts you haven't had yet.
02:42:27<Kita> <3
02:42:45<Laevos> I wouldn't be aware of any loss
02:42:49<Laevos> the thing is that it would hurt other people
02:43:05<Kita> You'd miss out
02:43:19<Kita> That's like leaving the theatre before the movie is over.
02:43:40 Kita: hugs.
02:43:49 Laevos: hugs
02:43:53<Laevos> I'm sure you can understand but
02:44:05<Laevos> I don't want to be alone anymore
02:44:23<Kita> Then... create friends.
02:44:26<Laevos> my partner had to go back to thousands of miles away when I got kicked out
02:44:34<Kita> :<
02:44:34<Laevos> tried to go over there over Winter break
02:44:35<Laevos> failed
02:44:48<Laevos> probably won't get another chance for... years
02:44:58<Laevos> it's kinda funny
02:45:01<Kita> Will they get a chance to see you?
02:45:05<Laevos> no
02:45:09<Laevos> they can't travel alone
02:45:10<Laevos> anxiety
02:45:18<Laevos> she can't, evne
02:45:19<Laevos> even
02:45:29<Laevos> but that's not the funny part
02:45:29<Laevos> just
02:45:40<Laevos> the people I was living with were the last friends I made
02:45:50<Laevos> never managed to do it again since the beginning of high school
02:46:12<Kita> Adults are different.
02:46:25<Kita> You have to make them want to interact with you.
02:46:32<Kita> You have to be interesting.
02:46:34<Laevos> I know
02:46:36<Laevos> and I'm not
02:46:44<Laevos> so I've given up on having friends, too
02:46:49<Kita> And you can be interesting, if you put out the vibe.
02:47:03<Kita> You have to treat YOURSELF as interesting.
02:47:19<Laevos> what was that about
02:47:21<Laevos> comforting lies?
02:47:27<Laevos> I don't think I could pull that off, either
02:47:48<Kita> Comforting lies?
02:47:52<Laevos> way back
02:47:57<Laevos> beginning of the discussion
02:47:59<Kita> How long as has Kita talked to Laevos, tonight.
02:48:04<Kita> It wouldn't be a lie.
02:48:26<Kita> Sure, Kita has talked a lot about herself, but she was interested in Laevos' reaction.
02:48:35<Laevos> I talk to people online
02:48:42<Laevos> and it's nice
02:48:48<Laevos> but I can't reproduce that vocally
02:48:58<Kita> Pretend it is all a screen.
02:49:14<Laevos> People would probably react badly to me trying to type on them
02:49:15<Kita> Imagine that screen in your mind.
02:49:18<Kita> X3
02:49:30<Laevos> the thing is
02:49:34<Kita> Kita is the same in the flesh as she is here.
02:49:41<Laevos> I'm good at professional settings
02:49:54<Kita> Sure. That is structured.
02:49:55<Laevos> I can talk to my instructors or supervisors about academic or work-related things
02:50:12<Kita> There is an obvious ettiquette
02:50:16<Laevos> I'm very active in participating in classes
02:50:21<Laevos> then people try to come and talk to me
02:50:28<Laevos> I answer whatever questions they have and then
02:50:31<Laevos> just nothing
02:50:53<Kita> Do you know what actually causes this?
02:51:08<Laevos> Not really
02:51:12<Kita> Okay
02:51:19<Kita> See the words that Kita is typing?
02:51:23<Laevos> Yes
02:51:25<Kita> These words have a voice.
02:51:33<Kita> That voice is attached to a person.
02:51:55<Laevos> Yes
02:51:55<Kita> You are talking to a physical entity. You can't see it, but it is here.
02:52:01<Kita> Want a face to associate?
02:52:09<Laevos> Sure
02:52:13<Kita> Okay
02:52:44 Kita: digs out her only picture of herself, that she took while really stoned in her senior year.
02:53:37<Kita> Some notes
02:53:46<Kita> Kita, yes, used to dye her hair.
02:54:01<Kita> Yes, she is wearing both make-up and custom coloured contacts.
02:54:23 Kita: lived in a mormon town, and would have been attacked for her appearance, so it was hidden.
02:54:33 Laevos: nods
02:54:38<Kita> http://imgur.com/omW1O7M
02:54:49<Kita> Also
02:55:04<Kita> Kita had a friend with a thing for ironic prettyboy posters.
02:55:15<Kita> Kita smoked pot with that friend, regularly.
02:55:34 Kita: still has an ironic appreciation of shitty prettyboy posters.
02:55:48<Laevos> Hehehe
02:56:00<Kita> Ugh
02:56:05<Laevos> What? :c
02:56:08<Kita> You can totally tell with the contacts...
02:56:14<Kita> They just look so fake
02:56:34<Laevos> You probably have a better eye for it than I do
02:56:37<Kita> That was four years ago.
02:57:23 Kita: has since washed the dye out of her hair and quit wearing the contact lenses... and quit using skintone make-up.
02:57:35<Laevos> I think we're roughly the same age, if you were a senior in HS then
02:57:39<Laevos> and, fair enough
02:57:46 Kita: has also put on a lot of weight.
02:57:57<Kita> Albino hair is fucking hard to dye.
02:58:04<Kita> Temp dyes are practically the only way.
02:58:07<Laevos> Really?
02:58:22<Kita> There is no pigment for the colour to latch onto.
02:58:28<Laevos> That's the opposite of what I would have expected
02:58:40<Kita> Albino hair has no pigment.
02:58:43<Laevos> since I know to dye dark hair you have to bleach it first
02:58:45<Laevos> but I guess
02:58:46<Laevos> yeah
02:58:56<Kita> Without pigment, there is nothing for the dye to cling to.
02:59:18<Kita> When you bleach the hair, you're sucking colour from the pigment, but it is still there.
02:59:24<Laevos> Okay
02:59:26<Laevos> that explains it then
02:59:39<Kita> yeah...
02:59:52<Kita> Kita was.... 260lbs in this picture?
03:00:03 Kita: is like 430, now.
03:00:17 Laevos: hugs
03:00:22 Kita: headtilts.
03:00:49<Laevos> I've been around 125 for...
03:00:57<Laevos> a pretty long time now
03:01:12 Kita: loves her body and finds it super sexy.
03:01:13<Kita> :P
03:01:16<Kita> No joke.
03:01:19<Laevos> I believe you
03:01:35<Laevos> my partner's maybe ~320 and she's absolutely beautiful
03:01:48<Laevos> plus much better for cuddling than my sharp, bony frame
03:02:15 Kita: is currently dating three girls.. 2 are lighter than Kita, but one is 700lbs bombshell.
03:02:17<Kita> <3
03:02:22<Laevos> <3
03:02:23<Kita> is a*
03:02:32<Kita> Too bad she is bedbound.
03:02:38<Laevos> aww
03:03:01<Kita> Very pretty though.
03:03:08<Laevos> Yay :3
03:03:12<Kita> Her caretaker is very good.
03:03:34<Kita> She has beautiful skin, excellent fat texture... No cellulite dimpling.
03:03:56<Laevos> Yeah, I know exactly what you mean
03:04:12<Kita> Also, she is an active gainer.
03:04:25<Kita> The other two... are accidental fatties.
03:04:51<Kita> And Kita could never convince either of them to gain, as they are super self-conscious about their weight.
03:05:04<Laevos> Yeah :/
03:05:43<Kita> Kita has met the 700lbs girl in person.
03:05:49<Laevos> How'd that go? <3
03:05:56<Kita> It was nice.
03:06:11<Kita> But it highlighted that this relationship probably won't last.
03:06:21<Laevos> Oh?
03:06:28<Kita> Kita is secondary to the other girl's caretaker.
03:06:53<Laevos> Ahh ;~;
03:07:15<Kita> Who isn't too thrilled that Kita and (Let's call her...) Jen have a relationship, but won't comment on it.
03:07:26<Laevos> :/
03:07:42<Laevos> That does sound like a bit of an impediment
03:08:04<Kita> Kita got to feed her a meal and brush her hair.
03:08:05<Kita> <3
03:08:21<Laevos> I'm happy for you that you were able to spend that time with her, at least <
03:08:22<Laevos> <3
03:08:43<Kita> The bigger the better, and she sure was big.
03:08:56<Laevos> What does it feel like to feed somebody?
03:09:03<Kita> Mmm...
03:09:42<Kita> Kita gets warm inside, and her guts knot up in a way that creates a pleasurable pressure in her.
03:10:04<Laevos> Are there foods that are more pleasurable to feel people?
03:10:08<Laevos> *feed
03:10:17<Kita> Sweets
03:10:26<Kita> Dairy products
03:10:26<Laevos> Marshmallows?
03:10:34 Kita: nods
03:10:56<Laevos> :3
03:11:01<Kita> Girls with marshmallow-texture fat are the best...
03:11:24<Kita> And feeding them marshmallows makes them that texure
03:11:52<Laevos> That does sound kind of nice... it sounds romantic to me, at least
03:12:34<Kita> Also, the bigger the person Kita feeds, the better the sensation.
03:13:33<Laevos> Yay <3 I'm sorry for my earlier food-related comments
03:13:49<Kita> Is okay
03:14:47<Laevos> I don't apply my standards of comfort to anyone else, and it makes me happy when people have things that make them happy, so, in that sense, that kind of fullness sounds beautiful <3
03:16:10 Kita: begins idly brush at her tail...
03:16:14<Kita> brushing*
03:16:32<Kita> Food is a lovely thing, if you know how to use it.
03:17:08<Kita> But food has been demonised as the fatmaker... And fat has been demonised as a result of laziness.
03:17:08<Kita> :<
03:17:18<Laevos> Yes, that's very unfortunate...
03:17:25<Kita> Jen has to do a lot of damn work to keep up her eating.
03:17:39<Laevos> I believe it ;n;
03:18:10<Kita> Fat can be pretty...
03:18:21<Laevos> can be beautiful
03:18:36<Kita> Obesity on its own doesn't cause nearly the amount of problems that a poor diet does.
03:18:51<Kita> It still causes some problems...
03:18:57<Laevos> I don't have any prediliction toward specific body types... hard to be attracted to people at all before I know them emotionally
03:19:03<Laevos> yes
03:19:26<Kita> (Though, mostly joint problems and organ failures at extreme levels of adiposal suffocation.)
03:19:44<Kita> Most fatties die from poor diet, before then.
03:19:52<Kita> But with proper care and diet planning...
03:20:05<Laevos> ^^
03:20:13<Kita> You can live for a long time as fatty.
03:20:54<Kita> Sure, the eventual bed-riddance can cause immuno-deficiency, from lack of exposure to diseases.
03:21:22<Kita> But that can be counteracted with vaccines/outside air flow.
03:21:32<Laevos> That's good :3
03:21:53 Kita: knows her shit.
03:21:59<Kita> Kita has to.
03:22:14<Kita> Otherwise, she is not a good person.
03:22:23<Laevos> Yeah, Kita seems very responsible
03:22:57<Kita> If the life of the feedee is not held in some regard... Kita is a bad, exploitative person, condemning a gullible person to suicide by fetish fulfillment... Which is wrong.
03:23:10<Laevos> Yes, it would be
03:24:05 Kita: offers a small slice of pound cake and is simply digging into the rest of the cake, herself.
03:24:23<Kita> Kita is also hypoglycemic.
03:24:39<Kita> She needs sugars. Her body processes them way too fast.
03:24:50<Kita> And causes a blood sugar deficiency
03:24:53 Laevos: nomps at gingerly
03:24:55<Laevos> Oh my :c
03:25:26<Kita> No diabetes for Kita
03:25:39<Laevos> Well that's good, at least
03:26:01 Kita: also has issues digesting cholesterol... so her body just passes it
03:26:18<Laevos> Wow o:
03:26:25<Kita> Yeah
03:26:33<Kita> Kita's genetics are fuckered
03:26:41<Kita> That's what happens when you're a drug baby
03:26:49<Kita> The seventh drug baby
03:27:08<Laevos> Wow... x_x
03:27:36<Laevos> I'm glad that Kita exists here now at least and hope that she enjoys her existence 
03:27:41 Kita: offers Laevos her biography.
03:27:45<Kita> XP
03:27:52<Laevos> I'd buy it
03:28:17<Laevos> What would it be called?
03:29:39<Kita> Parasol, Philosophy, and Psychosis.
03:29:56<Laevos> Yeah I'd buy it
03:30:36<Kita> The Physical Kita, the Real Kita, and the monster.
03:31:00<Laevos> plus it's got all those "P"s but not in an alliteration
03:31:20<Kita> Intentional.
03:31:20<Kita> X3
03:31:30<Laevos> Goooood, god
03:31:35<Laevos> *another good
03:32:25<Kita> Also
03:32:35<Kita> There are no good custom doll makers.
03:32:41<Laevos> Really? :c
03:32:47<Kita> Well
03:32:53<Kita> Not for life-size dolls.
03:32:57<Laevos> Oh, okay
03:32:58<Laevos> that's a shame :c
03:34:42 Kita: is wanting to commission a life-size, internally skeletoned, Gardevoir plush doll...
03:34:59<Laevos> That'd be really cool
03:35:54<Kita> Housing the ball and socket shoulder joints would be the hardest part.
03:36:03<Laevos> Yeah :/
03:36:19<Laevos> And, I'm afraid I've reached my limit for staying up, if I do so any more I'll surely oversleep and miss class :c
03:36:27<Laevos> but it's the weekend for me tomorrow after school, so!
03:36:35<Kita> Go sleep
03:36:38<Laevos> We can talk more about whatever manner of things
03:36:42 Kita: ushers Laevos along
03:36:44<Laevos> thanks for being a good person
03:36:45<Laevos> byebye

00:25:54<Kita> Kita can't wear dresses...
00:25:56<Kita> n.n;;
00:26:02<Laevos> Aww ;n;
00:26:08<Laevos> Kita can help me get the damn things off x3
00:26:14<Kita> Kita wears skirts, though.
00:26:20<Laevos> Yay! :3
00:26:46<Kita> They are special made, for Kita.
00:26:55<Laevos> <3 o:
00:27:12<Kita> Kita's waist is so slender in comparison to her hips... that regular fits dont really fit.
00:27:27<Kita> (Not to say that Kita has a slender waist...)
00:27:31<Laevos> Ooh, okay
00:27:49<Kita> So Kita gets tinier-waisted, super-flared out skirts.
00:31:38<Kita> So, in the Epic Battle Fantasy series, there is a cat, named NoLegs.
00:31:56<Kita> He has not legs, but can still move around.
00:32:13<Laevos> x3
00:32:15<Laevos> How?
00:32:16<Kita> Every once in a while, he is seen carrying things, despite not having arms.
00:32:24<Laevos> x3

00:48:14<Kita> So
00:48:25<Kita> tab is the nick for one of the mods on SurrealChat
00:48:39<Kita> He is pretty witty, and is know for his Global Messages...
00:48:47<Laevos> :3
00:48:53<Laevos> I need more window space
00:48:57<Kita> Such as tell people to change their passwords to something that ISN'T their nick.
00:48:58<Laevos> so I don't need two irssis
00:49:02<Laevos> hahahaha
00:49:17<Kita> And also tell people about gun mechanics!
00:49:28<Laevos> Uh-huh xD
00:49:29<Kita> [22:23] -tab- [Global Message] for the record, one does not reload a sub-machinegun by loading another clip in the cartridge. Seriously folks. What the hell? If you load one more cartridge into the clip it's a bit more correct but pointless on a smg... and really folks, it's "loading another magazine into the magwell" 
00:49:29<Kita> -
00:49:29<Kita> [22:24] -tab- [Global Message] learn your gun mechanics folks...   
00:49:29<Kita> -
00:49:29<Kita> [22:27] -tab- [Global Message] Ryan: You're in one of the crime capitals of the US. Guns and how they work shouldn't be that much of a stretch for you. 
00:50:11<Laevos> My response to him would probably, "Oh shut up you little shit xD"
00:50:22<Kita> He is right, though.
00:50:23<Kita> :p
00:50:29<Laevos> Yeah right
00:50:35<Laevos> people that purchase guns horrify me :)
00:50:48 Kita: only knows about gun mechanics because her brother has friend who is competition shooter.
00:50:54 Laevos: shudders
00:50:55 Kita: shrugs.
00:51:00<Kita> They don't bother Kita.
00:51:11<Kita> And Brock is cool.
00:51:36<Kita> He can hit a soda can with a slingshot from 200 yards away.
00:51:57<Kita> He is super focused on his skill as a crackshot.
00:52:55<Kita> To him, firing those rifles and pistols is the same as an athlete kicking a ball.
00:53:05<Kita> It's all sport. He doesn't even hunt.
00:53:15<Laevos> That's nice... can't be around firearms at all or I start to get very near panic-attack mode without anything even being done with them
00:53:28<Kita> He doesn't carry one around.
00:53:32<Laevos> if they were to start going off for any reason... I'd be on the floor, nonverbal besides crying
00:53:43<Kita> He does carry a slingshot, though.
00:54:12<Kita> You're very skittish and tightwound, hun.
00:54:20 Kita: rubs on Laevos' shoulders.
00:54:27<Laevos> Yes @_@
00:55:29<Kita> Look... The psychoactive and metaphysical aspects of meditation are bullshit... But the act of focusing your mind and developing a center of peace is very calming in relaxing.
00:55:42<Kita> Basically, its just finding your happy place.
00:55:49<Kita> You should try finding your happy place.
00:56:19<Laevos> Dunno what that means really... :/
00:56:25<Kita> *Full Disclaimer, What Kita is about to say is actually very serious*
00:56:34<Kita> Kita plays a lot of games.
00:56:47<Kita> Kita is very good at a lot of different types of games.
00:56:59<Kita> One of Kita's strongest genres is Bullet Hells.
00:57:19<Kita> When Kita plays Bullet Hells, she "finds her zone", so to speak.
00:57:32<Kita> She stops seeing the game, and her body just kind of plays on its own.
00:57:49<Kita> It is during that time that Kita would be in a "meditative" state.
00:58:13<Kita> Her focus has become so intense that she begins to play THROUGH the game, rather than play the game.
00:58:21<Kita> Her mind goes blank.
00:58:51<Kita> All thoughts in Kita's head cease, and the game disappears from her vision.
00:59:02<Kita> But Kita's eyes are still open, and she is still playing.
00:59:10<Kita> Pure muscle/imagery memory.
00:59:19<Kita> Laevos should find something like that.
00:59:53<Kita> Some sort of activity where Laevos becomes so focused and relaxed in the motions that her brain turns off, but she continues to do the activity.
01:00:17<Kita> After experiencing the feeling for a long time, Kita has become able to snap in and out at will.
01:00:22<Kita> When she is doing anything.
01:00:22<Kita> <3
01:03:42 Kita: licks.

13:40:29 Kita: is quite well... May need to go get groceries.
13:40:34<Laevos> Aww, okay
13:42:02<Laevos> What grocery store does Kita go to? o:
13:42:17<Laevos> Probably don't have Hy-Vee or Dillons out there? ;n;
13:43:59<Kita> Winco, to buy in bulk, and Albertson's or the nearish Farmer's Market for more singular items.
13:44:25<Laevos> Oh okay
13:44:32<Laevos> Are they pretty cool places? ;u;
13:44:52<Kita> They're alright...
13:45:06<Kita> One of the cashiers at Winco is a right fucktwit.
13:45:32<Laevos> :c
13:48:19<Kita> But...
13:48:21 Kita: shrugs.
13:48:26 Laevos: licks o:
13:48:30<Laevos> Yeah, what can you do
13:48:32<Kita> Good prices, decent quality on their output...
13:48:35<Laevos> besides slash their tires I guess
13:48:40<Laevos> Yay :D
13:48:43<Kita> The Farmer's Market is less so, on the prices.
13:48:56<Kita> But, they have the highest quality ingredients.

21:12:34<Laevos> Program assistant to the university's Institute for Digital Research in the Humanities!
21:12:55 Kita: snickers...
21:13:00<Kita> As a High Priestess.
21:13:01<Kita> X3
21:13:06<Laevos> That too
21:13:06<Laevos> >u>
21:13:10<Laevos> BUT

21:13:19<Laevos> (Bigger xux)
21:13:28 Kita: rubs on her chin...
21:13:40 Laevos: nuzzles, purring, doing homework but still here ;///////;
21:13:48<Laevos> Love  you, Kita... wanna feed you things Q_Q
21:13:49<Kita> Laevos should brag that she is the High Priestess of a Fox Deity.
21:14:00 Laevos: nodnods... ;////;
21:14:06<Laevos> It truly is an honor...

22:48:44 Kita: nibbles on the <3
22:49:10<Laevos> ouo
22:49:52 Kita: sniffs at Laevos neck and chest.
22:51:28 Laevos: blushies and stretches out ^//////^
22:51:54 Kita: whimpers
22:52:37 Laevos: nuzzles at Kita curiously
22:53:49 Kita: begins nibbling on her.
22:57:32 Laevos: shivers, "Does Kita need to be fed~? <3"
22:58:06 Kita: nods and begs.
22:59:24 Laevos: nods~ "What would Kita enjoy~?"
22:59:44 Kita: pins her ears back...
22:59:47<Kita> Anything
23:01:51 Laevos: nods, goes to the kitchen where a hissing sound is heard for a while, then she returns with a tray, heaping over with onion rings, the slight smell of the sweet root along with the grease and salt wafting in~. She lifts one up, holding it over the fox's mouth, lowering it lovingly~
23:02:47 Kita: opens her mouth, and waits for Laevos to indulge her hunger. <3
23:05:08 Laevos: places the still-hot ring into Kita's mouth, directly onto her tongue, letting the flavor soak into the muscle~
23:06:21 Kita: closes her maw around the crispy treat, crunching softly as she savors the flavour of the greasy ring... <3~ Mmmm...
23:08:41 Laevos: offers Kita her fingers, a bit of the salty remains still clinging to the digits~ "All for you, Goddess~ <3"
23:10:50 Kita: licks, yearningly, at each finger tip before huffing and opening her mouth again. She closes her eyes and holds her head tilted slightly up, an almost pretentiously regal posture, expecting Laevos to happily endure her duty. <3
23:12:34 Laevos: smiles widely, shivering as she serves in her role as High Priestess, fetching another few onion rings and placing them one after another into the fox's mouth, whimpering lovingly as she devours them, an act transcendent in its beauty. <3
23:13:24<Kita> (Ack. Be right back... >///<)
23:15:32<Laevos> (Same x///x)
23:21:10<Kita> (I'm back... ;.; Breasts started lactating... a fucking gain...)
23:21:56<Laevos> (Eep, I'm sorry! Dx stomach issues here x~x)
23:22:05 Laevos: hugs her Goddess close and clings ;-;
23:26:10 Kita: nuzzles at...
23:26:26<Kita> Fucking... mood ruined... by stupid milky titties. >.<
23:27:01 Laevos: kisses her temples... "I'm sorry..."
23:27:21 Kita: idly munches on onion rings herself, though. <3

00:15:01<Kita> For Kita's favourite flavour of ice cream~
00:15:21<Laevos> Hmm...
00:15:31<Laevos> Cookie dough? o_o
00:15:52<Kita> Good guess! But not correct.
00:15:55<Laevos> Hmmmmmm
00:16:51<Laevos> What abouuuuuuut...
00:17:32<Laevos> Cotton candy? >u>

00:19:27<Laevos> Ummmm
00:19:33<Laevos> Peanut-butter chocolate? :c
00:19:58<Kita> Another good guess, but no.
00:20:05<Kita> Mint and Chocolate Chip.
00:20:27<Laevos> Dang it!

00:48:45<Laevos> Yeah... x_x
00:48:48 Kita: can suck her own nipple, by the way.
00:49:01<Laevos> Can't reach mine :c
00:50:53 Kita: will offer Laevos a taste, if she wishes to satisfy curiosity.
00:53:30 Laevos: suckles at curiously <3
00:53:41<Kita> X3
00:53:59<Laevos> We have a thing for... not exactly the milk, but the action of doing that... very cathartic
00:54:06 Kita: meant in meatspace, but this works, too.
00:54:50<Laevos> Oh
00:55:02<Laevos> Laevos will try it in meatspace, too, if Kita will allow it then <3
00:55:18<Kita> wear a dress and some make-up.
00:55:29<Kita> Only requiremets
00:55:33<Kita> n*
00:55:58<Kita> Do keep in mind... It is a calorie NIGHTMARE.

14:01:58 Kita: scritches on her jaw.

14:02:16<Laevos> Hmmmm
14:02:24<Laevos> Recently haven't had a lot of time, buuuuuuut...
14:02:30<Laevos> video games can be fun!
14:02:33<Kita> X3
14:02:52<Kita> Do you prefer the older, simpler games, or the newer, more complex?
14:03:15<Kita> Or maybe you're an indie girl, with the retro look, but fresh, mechanic complexity?
14:03:16<Kita> XP
14:03:33<Laevos> not rly
14:03:38<Laevos> I like video games that are fun to play
14:03:43<Laevos> whatever form that might take :P
14:05:39<Kita> Kita likes Platformers and Bullet Hells.
14:06:06<Laevos> Yay
14:06:08<Kita> RPGs are good, but they have to be interesting... Final Fantasy 1? Not interesting. Digital Devil Saga? Interesting.
14:06:11<Laevos> I like platformers I suppose
14:06:36<Kita> Cave Story, La-Mulana, Adventure Story (Done by the same guy who did Epic Battle Fantasy!)
14:06:42<Kita> Good platformers.
14:06:43<Kita> Oh!
14:06:48<Kita> They Bleed Pixels
14:06:51<Kita> Also good.
14:08:35<Laevos> Played They Bleed Pixlies

15:11:30<Kita> Greater Than Games just released their new Kickstarter for their new game, Sentinels Tactics
15:11:30<Kita> <3
15:12:18<Laevos> Ooh o:
15:12:20<Laevos> How does it look?
15:14:04<Kita> Like Heroscape, except slightly more balanced, with a Sentinels of the Multiverse theme, and it has unique scenarios for you to play out.
15:14:48<Laevos> Oh okay :3
15:15:23<Kita> Did you ever play Heroscape? It was childishly themed, but the game was solid.
15:15:29<Laevos> Nope!
15:15:37<Laevos> Saw ads for it though
15:15:41<Kita> Ah.
15:15:43<Kita> Well
15:15:48<Kita> It's hex-grid tactics.

15:24:01<Laevos> Yay xux
15:24:09<Kita> Decon of Superhero stereotypes and archetypes.
15:24:21<Kita> Like...
15:24:23<Laevos> Cool :3
15:24:28<Kita> Tachyon is supahfast
15:24:33<Kita> And a physicist...
15:25:16<Kita> But instead of being normal otherwise, like the flash, she is always talking and talks REALLY fast, and uses big words ALL the time.
15:25:49<Kita> Legacy often has to ask her to "Slow down, and give me the simple version."
15:26:05<Laevos> x3
15:26:21<Kita> Her usage in the original game boils down to...
15:26:57<Kita> Use cards for tiny little bits of damage, then bomb a special card for massive damage.
15:27:06<Laevos> :D
15:27:10<Kita> Like a rogue!
15:27:25<Kita> You gently poke and dodge to detect opponent weakspots and behaviours...
15:27:30<Laevos> Especially useful against giant enemy crabs
15:27:40<Kita> Then BOOM. Hit them where it really fucking hurts for maximum damage!
15:28:10<Kita> Legacy is a cool concept... Every generation, their children inherit their parents powers, and get a new one.
15:28:28<Kita> The original Legacy had super strength!
15:28:39<Kita> The next one had Super strength and super endurance!
15:28:51<Laevos> Ooh :3
15:28:53<Kita> The next one had that, and then flight!
15:29:00<Kita> And so forth and so on.
15:29:04<Laevos> Sounds pretty neat
15:29:10<Laevos> But what if they don't have babys
15:29:20<Kita> well...
15:29:24<Kita> That's the thing...
15:29:31<Kita> They just always have.
15:29:34<Laevos> SO FAR
15:29:39<Kita> Yeah.
15:30:03<Kita> And the Legacy family has a strong sense of tradition and pride in their Legacy.
15:30:19<Laevos> Eventually one's going to be invisible or made out of lava and THEN WHAT?
15:30:52<Kita> There is always the Absolute Zero route.
15:30:56<Kita> He was a janitor
15:31:03<Laevos> Best superpower
15:31:06<Kita> Got caught in a weird accident
15:31:24<Kita> Can't live outside a near 0K environment.
15:31:28<Kita> Gets Cryosuit
15:31:43<Kita> He is basically Cold Iron Man.
15:33:39<Laevos> o:

15:36:05<Kita> Yush

15:36:24<Kita> Different artist, but all official from Galactic Strike Force.
15:36:32<Kita> all? also*
15:37:04<Laevos> Oh okay
15:37:31<Kita> http://thurotdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/1-whos-the-zero-now.jpg
15:37:42<Kita> That is from the original, when he is defeated in battle.
15:41:08<Kita> http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1630193_md.png
15:41:22<Laevos> Ah okay
15:41:26<Laevos> Not too keen on the art style
15:41:27<Laevos> but whateva
15:41:30<Kita> From the expansion that included Iron Legacy, which was Legacy gone bad guy.
15:41:56<Kita> Kita figured it was supposed to emulate nineties B-comics.
15:42:01<Laevos> Maybe
15:42:11<Kita> Like Blue Beetle...
15:42:44<Kita> Also, Tempest was original The Inhuman Tempest
15:42:49<Laevos> http://sentinelsofthemultiverse.com/sites/default/files/cards/images/absolute%20zero.png This one was the worst I guess
15:42:52<Laevos> as far as artness
15:43:02<Kita> And Bunker, Engine of War was originally the Infragible Bunker.
15:43:11<Laevos> Huh
15:43:28<Kita> In Iron Legacy they had name changes.
15:44:00<Kita> Unity was also, originally, mostly human, but augmented herself with her technomancy powers.
15:45:07<Kita> Wraith is chick Batman with less training, less pussiness, and less fake emotional baggage.
15:45:23<Laevos> Uh-huh
15:45:44<Kita> She doesn't like to kill, but does when she can't immediately avoid it.
15:46:03<Laevos> Sounds worse than Batman in every concievable way >:c
15:46:20<Kita> Batman sucks. He is the definition of Mary Sue.
15:46:26<Laevos> omggg
15:46:38<Kita> The only thing he doesn't do wrong is be a self-insert.
15:46:46<Kita> </MarvelComicFangirl>
15:46:55<Laevos> I've never liked any Marvel Comics to be honest
15:47:08<Kita> Iron Man is awesome.
15:47:09<Kita> :<
15:47:18<Laevos> Iron Man is perhaps my least favorite of them xD
15:47:25<Kita> Also, Squirrel Girl.
15:47:28<Laevos> A rich alcoholic who goes around being an asshole
15:47:53<Laevos> Nah, I can go and visit my dad anytime.
15:48:22<Kita> He is actually a genius tortured by the pressure of living in his father's footsteps, and, like many people, turned to a vice for comfort, because he had no one.
15:48:32<Laevos> aww
15:48:35<Laevos> poor rich white guy
15:48:40<Laevos> so sad for your loss :c
15:48:48<Kita> >:
15:48:49<Laevos> wait no he's just an asshole nevermind
15:49:08<Kita> he didn't lose anything.
15:49:18<Laevos> The Lost of Mercy
15:49:19<Laevos> wait no
15:49:28<Kita> He is upset because he can have anything he wanted, except the love of his father, which is the ONLY thing he wants.
15:49:35<Laevos> :'c
15:50:23<Kita> Once he finds that, and builds the new Ark Reactor core, he gets over the alcoholism, and begins to take his job as an Avenger more seriously.
15:50:45<Laevos> You say that, but
15:50:59<Laevos> you also claim that Homestuck is good, so... I have to take things with a grain of salt, you know :c
15:51:08<Kita> Homestuck IS good.
15:51:16<Laevos> Uh-huh :P
15:51:39<Kita> You probably wouldn't like Odysseus, either.
15:51:52<Laevos> Is it a webcomic?
15:51:57<Kita> No.
15:52:13<Kita> It is one of the most discussed, and least read, pieces of literature, ever.
15:52:44<Laevos> Oh, Ulysses
15:52:48<Laevos> l.o.l.
15:53:11<Laevos> It's pretty amusing that you would compare a webcomic to a work of ancient literature
15:53:14<Laevos> AMUSING
15:53:28<Laevos> but not exactly inspiring as far as confidence of your taste in media goes >_>
15:55:45 Kita: rubs on her muzzle...
15:55:56<Kita> Kita has a horrible recollection of names.
15:55:58<Kita> Fffff...
15:56:04<Kita> Kita's point...
15:56:16<Kita> Just because you don't like it, doesn't mean it isn't good.
15:56:26<Laevos> That's actually the definition of quality :D
15:56:26<Kita> Just because you do like it, doesn't make it good.
15:56:41<Kita> There are more objective definitions...
15:56:44<Kita> For instance...
15:56:57<Laevos> Objective quality is also a very amusing, but not at all useful, category.
15:57:36<Kita> Twilight. Just because everyone, their mother, and their aunt's fucking pussy loved the book, didn't make it good literature.
15:57:48<Kita> Popular =! Quality.
15:57:53<Laevos> Indeed not.
15:58:03<Laevos> Quality is determined by whether or not I like it. :P
15:58:13 Kita: baps with marshmallow.
15:58:56<Laevos> There are no useful definitions of quality outside of personal taste, because in the end that's what it all boils down to, what an individual likes or doesn't like.
15:59:03<Kita> Of course.
15:59:16<Kita> But you can't discredit a work on the sole measure of not liking it.
15:59:20<Laevos> Sure I can
15:59:23<Laevos> I do it all the tiem!
15:59:24<Laevos> *time! :D
15:59:32<Kita> You can not like it, but you shouldn't say that it sucks because you don't.
15:59:41<Laevos> Sure I should!
15:59:46<Laevos> And I do, with extreme frequency!
16:00:05<Laevos> Obviously I would like it if it were good
16:00:22<Kita> Not really. Labeling yourself as the sole decider of the quality of art is a narcissitic and egotistical viewpoint, beyond even Kita's levels.
16:00:36<Laevos> I mean, other people can think that something's good
16:00:40<Kita> You can see merit of skill in things that you may not like.
16:00:42<Laevos> and that's fine, it doesn't bother me any
16:00:55<Laevos> obviously if I thought they had merit, I'd like them!
16:01:12<Laevos> Technical skill is a separate quality wholly unrelated to /quality/ of perception.
16:01:22<Laevos> Rather, I suppose I should say it's a 'quantity'.
16:02:01<Kita> League of Legends is actually a really nicely put together game, but Kita doesn't like it.
16:02:07<Laevos> Nah, it sucks :D
16:02:19<Laevos> Absoultly without any redeeming features.
16:02:37<Laevos> From the game itself to the mental composition of those who partake in it.
16:02:43<Kita> No, the FANS and PLAYERS suck. The game itself would actually be quite fun if it were just regular people playing for laughs.
16:03:06<Laevos> Pfft :P
16:03:18<Kita> And the mental composition was formed from things outside the game. The game attracted that core of people because, like everything, there were outside factors involved in the composition of their mind.
16:03:25<Kita> The world is nothing but variables.
16:03:32<Laevos> What a disgusting sentence.
16:03:44<Laevos> It fills me with the deepest rage even to glance upon that sickly combination of words.
16:03:52<Kita> That the world is variables?
16:03:53<Laevos> Go and clean the filth off of your hands that must surely have resulted from typing it.
16:03:57<Laevos> CLEAN IT OFF.
16:03:58<Laevos> NOW.
16:04:42<Laevos> And don't ever /dare/ to utter such vile insolence around me as long as I continue to draw breath.
16:04:44<Kita> Do you find that it cheapens or diminishes the perception of reality?
16:04:58<Laevos> This is not a topic that I am or every will be open to debate.
16:05:02 Kita: blinks.
16:05:07<Kita> Kita doesn't understand.
16:05:20<Kita> Kita would like a calm, non-volatile explanation please.
16:05:20<Laevos> While I can not change your perception of the world, you will refrain from voicing it to me ever again if you wish to remain on speaking terms.
16:05:25<Laevos> I refuse to provide such.
16:05:37<Kita> She promises to remain quiet while it is explained.
16:05:42<Laevos> I refuse.
16:06:42<Kita> If... Kita doesn't get explanation, she cannot promise she won't accidentally trigger Laevos' wrath with a combination of words that broaches a similar topic...
16:07:12<Laevos> If science can somehow prove, beyond any shadow of a doubt, that what you say is true, I will take my own life on the spot.
16:07:23<Laevos> Such a world would be wholly unfit for me to inhabit.
16:07:27<Kita> Are you religious?
16:07:30<Laevos> No.
16:07:35<Kita> Spiritual
16:07:39<Laevos> No.
16:07:52<Kita> But you seem to believe in a greater purpose?
16:07:54<Laevos> No.
16:07:58<Kita> ...
16:08:03<Kita> Then Kita doesn't understand.
16:08:15<Kita> This is a concept Kita is foreign to.
16:08:31<Kita> Kita wishes for it to not be foreign.
16:08:32<Laevos> I refuse to explain because I do not believe you to be psychologically capable of understanding, and do not wish to put myself through the emotional trauma of trying to elucidate you.
16:08:34<Kita> Educate her.
16:09:02<Kita> Kita is actually insane. She is technically incapable of understanding emotiions.
16:09:16<Kita> Yet, here she is, attempting to find a way to defend Laevos' emotions.
16:09:44<Kita> If Kita is incapable of understanding, she'll let it drop.
16:09:46<Laevos> There is no logical defense. There is only what I feel, that is the extent of my universe.
16:10:13<Kita> Then don't defend it. Just speak it. Kita isn't attacking Laevos, here.
16:10:28<Kita> Kita wishes to understand, but acknowledges the possibility she might not.
16:10:55<Kita> If Kita doesn't, she won't attack, but she will attempt to accomodate.
16:11:04 Kita: pets her ears.
16:11:26<Kita> Kita would not have said it like that if she had known.
16:11:58<Laevos> The idea that the world, the universe, life, could be distilled to nothing more than a series of data and formulae is one that makes me want to vomit. It is such a limiting, disgraceful, ignorant view of the world that it baffles me that anyone but an automata could come to such a conclusion.
16:12:17<Laevos> It's perhaps even more insulting to the very core of my being than those who claim that the human mind is nothing more than a computer.
16:12:25<Laevos> It's revolting.
16:12:49<Kita> So then... What is reality then, instead of that?
16:13:16<Kita> Because if it can't be that, it must be something else. If Laevos knows, or has an idea, Kita is curious as to what it is.
16:13:20<Laevos> Something beyond the ken of humankind, as it should remain.
16:14:07<Kita> Kita has been compared to a machine before.
16:14:08<Kita> :P
16:14:16 Kita: nuzzles.
16:15:21<Laevos> I feel cold inside
16:15:39<Laevos> like somebody replaced my insides with gelatinous ice.
16:16:06<Laevos> While, at the same time, putting my head under a crushing weight of granite
16:16:09<Laevos> pushing it in from all sides.
16:16:18 Kita: ear droops.
16:16:35<Kita> Has Kita disappointed Laevos?
16:17:20<Laevos> I am in outstanding pain, my body will not stop shaking.
16:17:42<Kita> Well, you got really worked up.
16:17:47<Laevos> Yes.
16:18:00<Kita> Probably after trying to stop yourself from getting worked up?
16:18:14<Laevos> No idea.
16:18:30 Kita: offers her hands.
16:18:46<Kita> Just breathe deeply. Do you have access to water?
16:18:49<Laevos> don't touch me...
16:18:56<Laevos> I want to feel the pain until it goes
16:18:59<Kita> A little bit to drink might help...
16:19:04<Kita> Okay...
16:19:13<Laevos> it's the only thing I can hold on to right now
16:19:25<Kita> A little odd, but alright. Kita will let Laevos be.
16:20:19<Laevos> ok
16:20:47<Kita> Getting a drink might stop the inconvenience of the shaking, though.
16:20:48<Kita> <3
16:20:57<Kita> Let Kita know when you calm down, hun.

22:04:31<Kita> Don't leave Kita be...
22:04:41 Kita: ear droops.

22:04:56 Laevos: mews, clings
22:05:03<Laevos> I do love Kita...
22:05:06<Kita> You don't have to apologise.
22:05:36<Kita> Just next time, consider that while Kita is a deity, she is not telepathic.
22:05:47<Kita> Otherwise she would ask for prayer.
22:06:55<Laevos> Yes Goddess...
22:07:11 Kita: rubrubs on her nosey.
22:07:31<Laevos> It pains me greatly that I reacted in such a way... I nearly didn't complete the drive to the lecture because I felt so crushed and empty...
22:07:50<Kita> Kita still loves Laevos.
22:08:36<Laevos> Thank you...
22:08:45<Laevos> Laevos couldn't stop loving Kita...
22:09:06 Laevos: is wound so tight that sometimes she springs apart in all directions and has to coil herself back up...
22:09:28<Kita> Laevos needs to learn zen.
22:09:40<Kita> Calmness...
22:10:56<Laevos> sometimes Laevos is calm, at peace, but other times she... all of a sudden is sent into such tenseness that she can't even see clearly anymore
22:11:25<Kita> Which means that Laevos may not be at calm and at peace...
22:11:29<Kita> Just settled.
22:11:36<Laevos> probably
22:11:51<Kita> The angry feelings and bad emotions are still there, but their density sunk them to the bottom of the pool.
22:12:15<Kita> And if anyway starts moving through it, it stirs them up and they breach the surface.
22:13:30<Laevos> Most likely...
22:14:12<Kita> When Laevos comes, Kita will take her to Kita's hot tub, and try water therapy with Laevos.
22:14:13<Kita> <3
22:14:42 Kita: will even wear her bikini for Laevos. |3

13:32:32 Laevos: pets with her other hand while offering the first for noms
13:32:55 Kita: rubs her teeth on the fingers.
13:37:07 Laevos: rubs her fingers against the teeth <3
13:38:29<Kita> Alright...
13:38:34<Kita> Which Pokemon is first...
13:39:12<Kita> Bulbasaur, #001 in the Pokedex, Rhydon, the first Pokemon ever designed, Mew, the common ancestor of all Pokemon, or Arceus, origin of all existence?
13:42:04<Laevos> Rhydon duh
13:42:30<Kita> :P
13:42:55<Kita> Technically, it is a trick question. Depending on the context of first, it could be any of them.
13:43:40<Laevos> Well yeah, but
13:43:43<Laevos> still Rhydon, duh
13:43:53<Laevos> >u>
13:44:10<Kita> Rhydon is actually really hard to use in battle.
13:44:33<Kita> Even its evolution, Rhyperior, is difficult to use.
13:46:45<Kita> However, a lot of people have FINALLY excepted the idea that Arceus' role in the origin of Pokemon is HEAVILY embelished in the Sinnoh mythology, and that Arceus is actually not powerful enough to create all that is.

13:52:02<Laevos> Oh really? o:
13:55:37<Kita> Yush
13:56:05<Kita> Seeing as Arceus cannot summon meteors or create planets in battle.
13:56:13<Kita> But it does have a move called Judgement
13:57:06<Laevos> That's true o:
13:57:33<Kita> It is the Alpha Pokemon, and its theme seems to be that of "The Almight Judge
13:57:34<Kita> "
13:57:39<Kita> Almighty*
13:58:45<Kita> And in Battle Revolution for the Wii...
13:59:02<Kita> The announcer yells "Judgement has been dealt!" when the move is used.
13:59:03<Kita> X3
14:00:07<Kita> Also! If you use Smeargle's only learnable move, Sketch, on Judgement, it WILL Sketch it!
14:00:19<Kita> Making it one of only two Pokemon that can learn it.
14:01:57<Kita> And if you give Smeargle one of the Plate items (which change Arceus' type and the type of the move Judgement), it does change its type!
14:01:58<Kita> X3
14:02:12<Kita> Not Smeargle's type, but the type of the move Judgement.
14:02:47<Laevos> Nice xD
14:02:52<Laevos> Smeargle #1
14:03:04<Kita> Smeargle is silly, and gimmicky...
14:03:08<Kita> But it works for him.
14:03:12<Laevos> #1 in the hood, G
14:03:21<Kita> Oh god.
14:03:23<Kita> D:
14:03:37<Kita> But uhh
14:03:37<Laevos> ?_?
14:03:46<Kita> In Kita's rulesets, Smeargle isn't banned!
14:03:49<Kita> :3
14:03:56<Kita> (In some Smogon sets, it is.)
14:04:01<Laevos> (lol :c)
14:04:09<Kita> And Smeargle is allowed to have ANY move combo.
14:04:32<Laevos> Yay :D
14:04:48<Kita> yeah.
14:04:55<Laevos> Can Sketch make Smeargle learn one move multiple times?
14:05:00<Kita> No.
14:05:00<Kita> :<
14:05:02<Laevos> Aww
14:05:51<Kita> The West Coast Battling Initiative (A lot better sounding and less pretentious than Smogon University) aims to create a more free-formed Pokemon battling environment.
14:06:55<Laevos> That's cool
14:07:19<Kita> It's Kita's "battling league"
14:07:24<Kita> Current Population? 1.
14:07:25<Kita> ;.;
14:07:29<Laevos> Aww ;n;
14:07:44<Laevos> If Laevos had more Pokemon games, she would join, but she isn't even in the West Coast, so... :c
14:08:19<Kita> The WCBI is only named such, because of its origination location.
14:08:25<Laevos> ;u;
14:08:27<Kita> It STARTED on the West Coast.
14:09:08<Kita> WCBI encourages the abuse of human psychological patterns in the game to create a more fluid, erratic metagame environment.
14:10:12<Kita> Smogon rulesets lead to an almost sinewave set of team trends.
14:10:55<Laevos> Yours sound better :D
14:11:20<Laevos> But anyway
14:11:25<Laevos> time to head to class
14:11:31 Kita: nods.
14:11:35<Kita> More when you get back?
14:11:37<Laevos> Talk to you later, QT 3.14...
14:11:38<Laevos> Yes :3

17:50:13<Laevos> Yeah, my sister's getting her own place
17:50:17<Laevos> so I need to do the same
17:50:22<Kita> :<
17:50:34<Laevos> <3
17:50:39<Kita> 1 bedroom places exist.
17:50:41<Laevos> yes
17:50:52<Laevos> I just also need one where I can fit my stuff
17:51:25<Kita> If you don't plan on having people around, boxes in living room is always an option.
17:51:40<Laevos> @_@
17:51:47<Laevos> that is true
17:51:53<Kita> Kita's brother owns a few 1-bedroom places, because he travels to those places often.

22:18:49<Laevos> :3
22:19:35<Kita> RNG Abuse is something you can do with just the system and the game. No extra software, no extra hardware. The default equipment with no alteration.
22:20:10<Kita> You set your clock weird, perform a bunch of actions a certain number of times, and boom. Your RNG seed is set to put out a specific set of number patterns.
22:20:34<Kita> (Because Random Number Generators are actually Pseudo random)
22:20:46<Laevos> Yeah
22:20:54<Kita> So it isn't cheating.
22:21:02<Kita> It's just abusing the mechanics.
22:21:41<Kita> Which is just fine. It is part of the game, and not even a guarantee that you'll get the IVs and nature you want.
22:24:44<Kita> Just a way of making Legendary Pokemon more consistent.
22:25:22<Kita> (Not that Kita uses them, ever... But some people do! And it is okay that they do! But the WCBI only lets you use Legendaries against other Legendaries.)
22:26:02<Laevos> Huh ;w;
22:28:39<Kita> But non-competitive players bitch that they can't win online.
22:29:10<Laevos> uh-huh

22:53:54<Laevos> only now there'll be nowhere for me to go
22:53:57<Laevos> nobody for me to stay with
22:56:23<Kita> :<
22:56:31<Kita> Laevos can figure it out.
22:56:35<Laevos> I feel like I want to give  up
22:56:37<Kita> Living alone isn't so hard.
22:56:38<Kita> ;<
22:57:35<Laevos> I can't do it
22:58:10 Kita: thinks Laevos can do it, if she talks to Kita, everyday.
22:58:10<Kita> <3
22:58:25<Kita> Kita is here for Laevos.
22:59:34<Laevos> the thing is
22:59:42<Laevos> Laevos needs face-to-face interaction with beings
22:59:50<Kita> :<
22:59:51<Laevos> it's already been cut down phenomenally from what it was
22:59:59<Laevos> when I had friends
23:00:02<Laevos> now I won't even have family
23:00:08<Kita> No friends at school?
23:00:11<Laevos> none
23:00:24<Kita> Well, you got a little bit of time left to make one, yeah?
23:00:33<Laevos> not really...
23:00:41<Laevos> everyone I even somewhat know is going to be graduating
23:01:42<Kita> Okay... okay...
23:01:59<Kita> Maybe this is an opportunity for Laevos to learn to stand on her own?
23:03:34<Laevos> doubt it
23:03:49<Laevos> don't think I can make such a huge adjustment to my basic psychological needs when I have so much else going on
23:03:55<Laevos> school, work, namely
23:06:03<Kita> Hey... hey...
23:06:26<Kita> You can always just... go out.
23:06:41<Laevos> where, the bars?
23:06:52<Kita> It isn't ideal, but if you need to be around people, you can go find people to be around.
23:06:53<Laevos> that's the only place that people seem to congregate in this fucking town
23:07:04<Kita> Then make a new reason.
23:07:12<Laevos> such as?
23:07:34<Kita> Try congolmerating gamers together.
23:07:43<Kita> conglomerating*
23:08:08<Laevos> I don't have time...
23:08:29<Laevos> neither the time nor the energy to go to or host events of that nature
23:08:34<Laevos> I just need people to physically be around
23:08:39<Laevos> but that's going to be all gone soon
23:09:00<Kita> Okay... Then go to a bar and drink some water for a bit, then leave.
23:09:24<Laevos> bars make me uncomfortable
23:09:30<Laevos> I can't go into them
23:09:50 Kita: frowns...
23:10:01<Kita> Then Kita doesn't have an answer.
23:10:09<Laevos> there is none
23:10:15<Laevos> Laevos needs to kill herself
23:10:16<Laevos> because
23:10:21 Kita: growls.
23:10:22<Kita> No.
23:10:27<Laevos> the situation is untenable
23:10:29<Kita> You're going to just deal with it.
23:10:55<Kita> Because you CAN overcome it.
23:10:57<Kita> it is hard.
23:11:04<Laevos> Laevos doesn't have the effort to fight anymore
23:11:05<Kita> But hard doesn't mean impossible.
23:11:12<Laevos> she isn't a fighter
23:11:15<Kita> Then use Kita's.
23:11:18<Kita> :<
23:11:21<Laevos> she can't
23:11:27<Laevos> tired of living for other people
23:11:31<Laevos> I hate being alive...
23:12:17 Kita: whimpers.
23:12:31<Kita> Seriously? You're serious?
23:12:42<Laevos> hate it...
23:12:48<Kita> You really do?
23:13:00<Laevos> it's the most painful thing in the world
23:13:23<Kita> Kita doesn't condone it.
23:13:24<Kita> :<
23:13:33<Kita> But it isn't Kita's life.
23:14:42<Kita> Kita DEFINITELY thinks Laevos SHOULD consider other options.
23:15:02<Laevos> can't think
23:15:06<Laevos> the whole house smells like cat shit
23:15:08<Laevos> the wind is so loud
23:15:11<Laevos> can't...
23:15:25<Kita> Then Laevos needs to find another place to think.
23:15:37<Kita> Clean pillow case over your head.
23:15:42<Kita> Freshly clean.
23:15:54<Kita> Smells nice, is quieter.
23:16:09<Kita> Also dark.
23:16:14<Kita> Dark is good for thinking.
23:16:35<Laevos> I have so much homework
23:16:45<Kita> Take a moment.
23:16:48<Laevos> and I can't even do it because the instructor didn't attach the other page of the worksheet
23:16:50<Kita> 5 minutes, okay?
23:16:53<Laevos> it's already 23:00
23:16:58<Laevos> I'm already sitting here doing nothing
23:17:00<Laevos> there's nowhere else to go
23:17:12<Laevos> kill me...
23:17:19<Kita> Did you e-mail the instructor about the page, Laevos?
23:17:28<Laevos> haven't had the energy to yet
23:17:50<Kita> Make sure you do that, okay?
23:18:00 Kita: holds her hand.
23:18:38<Laevos> it'd be impolite to trouble her on behalf of someone who won't be in class anymore...
23:19:02<Kita> But, it would be dumb to not have it there, just in case you decide not to.
23:19:12<Laevos> ok
23:19:20<Kita> Agreed?
23:20:00<Kita> Because if you don't have the energy to write a simple e-mail... How will you have the energy to do something as stressful as killing yourself
23:20:19<Kita> The answer is that you won't.
23:20:37<Laevos> kill me please
23:20:59 Kita: pets Laevos' ears...
23:21:06<Kita> Kita can't do that.
23:21:13<Laevos> mortals are allowed to sacrifice themselves to deities
23:21:53<Kita> Kita is not one of those deities. :<
23:22:13<Laevos> I'm crying now
23:22:27<Kita> Kita is sorry she can't do that, Laevos.
23:25:47 Kita: hugs, tightly.
23:26:04<Kita> Kita isn't a real goddess, but loves that Laevos indulges her wishes...
23:29:32<Laevos> i hate this
23:29:55 Kita: whimpers.
23:30:07<Laevos> imi soryy
23:30:12<Kita> Kita wants to make it better, without hurting Laevos.

23:30:17<Kita> She really does.
23:30:23<Kita> Is there anything Kita can do?
23:30:37<Laevos> no... nobody can hlep me anymore
23:30:57 Kita: squeezes Lilith's hands...
23:31:05<Kita> Kiss? Just in case you do?
23:31:24 Laevos: kisses

23:59:49<Kita> Coping mechanisms are alright...
--- Day changed Thu Mar 27 2014
00:00:03<Kita> But they shouldn't be used to avoid problems.
00:00:27<Laevos> not even sure what the problems are
00:01:19<Kita> Maybe talking with Kita could help bring them to light?
00:01:40<Laevos> maybe
00:01:59<Kita> <3
00:02:22<Laevos> <3... not sure how to even begin x~x
00:02:53<Kita> Well...
00:03:03<Kita> Let's look at that personal contact thing...
00:03:55<Laevos> as you wish, Goddess... <3
00:04:07<Kita> What feelings does being around people help alleviate? 
00:04:29<Kita> Anxiety? Depression? Self-hatred?
00:04:32<Laevos> Loneliness, depression, fear, difficulty sleeping, tenseness
00:04:38 Kita: nods...
00:04:58<Kita> What is it about them? Is it that you don't have to think about yourself?
00:05:11<Laevos> maybe... I'm not alone anymore...
00:05:46 Kita: nuzzles.
00:06:32<Kita> Look... As long as that combo of letters, K, I, T, and A, appears in the nicklist... Kita will see any message Lilith gives her.
00:06:44<Kita> If Lilith ever feels alone... She can message Kita.
00:06:51<Kita> Kita will read it.
00:07:10<Kita> Maybe not always right away, but Kita is practically addicted to her computer. :P
00:07:14<Kita> She'll see it for sure.
00:07:35<Laevos> <3... and Lilith loves Kita and talking to her
00:07:35<Kita> So know that, no matter how bad it is, you go Kita to tell things to.
00:07:56<Kita> Lilith is free to rant at an empty message box, so Kita can read it later.
00:07:57<Laevos> but it doesn't, unfortunately, fulfill her psychological need for physical proximity to others
00:08:31<Kita> Kita doesn't expect it, to... But maybe getting the feelings OUT could help.
00:08:44<Kita> And make it so you don't NEED the physical proximity, anymore.
00:08:52<Kita> And don't be afraid to cry.
00:08:56<Kita> It's healthy.
00:09:45<Laevos> I cry a lot
00:10:03<Kita> Not good that you cry a lot, but good that you do cry when you need it.
00:10:04<Kita> <3
00:10:20<Laevos> <3
00:10:42 Kita: offers a bite of rice?
00:10:57 Laevos: noms
00:11:06<Kita> Good kitty.

00:35:52<Kita> Yeah?
00:36:58<Laevos> http://pcpartpicker.com/p/3hNdO This is what I have so far
00:37:30<Kita> AMD is a more trustworthy core, and might be less expensive.
00:37:37<Kita> Source: Kita has built a few computers.
00:37:42<Laevos> it probably is
00:37:46<Laevos> that's what my other friend is telling me
00:37:55<Laevos> as well
00:38:00<Laevos> so I'll probably switch that and the motherboard
00:38:16<Kita> Oh yeah. ASUS Motherboards are pretty good.
00:38:25<Kita> And also not as expensive.
00:38:50<Laevos> Hmm
00:39:00<Laevos> what'd be an equivalent AMD CPU to the i7?
00:39:20<Kita> Well
00:40:07<Kita> Were you willing to pay that price for the i7 before learning about other options?
00:40:13<Laevos> Yeah
00:40:19<Kita> Okay
00:40:27<Kita> Then Kita may have some awesome news.

21:03:58<Kita> Recital hall?
21:04:01<Laevos> so I could help my sister pass one of her classes

21:04:16<Laevos> that she doesn't have time to actually go to

21:04:52<Laevos> because we are bffs ;n;

21:06:45<Kita> Which is humourous.
21:06:54<Kita> Because his parents adopted Kita.
21:06:55<Kita> :P

22:01:54<Kita> Kiv is a big guy. He smashes faces. He won't move on to UFC, because he... doesn't pull his punches.
22:02:05<Laevos> ;w;
22:02:15<Laevos> Kiv is a cool name
22:02:19<Kita> He finds it to be great stress relief.
22:02:25<Kita> Kivaya is his name.
22:02:29<Kita> Kita calls him Kiv.
22:02:48<Laevos> Kivaya is... also a cool name
22:02:52<Laevos> did you say he was German? o_o

22:03:00<Laevos> Oh okay
22:03:12<Laevos> I would have guessed some kind of Slavic from the name, never heard that before
22:03:22<Kita> It isn't traditional.
22:03:28<Laevos> Okay
22:03:44<Laevos> I can believe that!

22:05:48<Kita> He likes pretzels.
22:05:50<Kita> And beer.
22:05:57<Kita> But he hates American beer.
22:06:03<Kita> And Aussie beer
22:06:07<Kita> And Canadian beer.
22:06:09<Laevos> From what I hear, that's a pretty common sentiment
22:06:14<Laevos> esp. from the Germans I know
22:06:19<Kita> He likes Irish beer, and German beer.
22:08:19<Laevos> Do you know what part of Germany his family was from?
22:08:48<Kita> Uhhh...
22:08:51<Kita> West
22:08:58<Kita> o.o
22:09:20<Laevos> Oh, okay xD
22:09:28<Kita> His father was a much older Gentleman.
22:09:41<Laevos> I didn't know if they were from a specific Bundesland or whatnot
22:10:04 Kita: wouldn't know. She didn't come into the picture until they were American citizens.

02:28:10<Kita> Yush.
02:28:43<Kita> But not very tender, so you have to tenderise with citric acids and vinegar...
02:29:02<Kita> Which means it is a meat to marinade.

02:30:56<Laevos> Yay :3

02:34:58<Laevos> I'm sure they love you, too, Kita <3
02:35:55<Kita> Kita would get more rabbits to raise...
02:36:07<Kita> But a certain snarky foxbutt here...
02:36:13<Laevos> awww ;n;
02:36:16 Kita: glances towards Kitsunari's bed...
02:36:27<Kita> "Hunted" the last one.
02:36:28<Kita> x.x
02:36:34<Laevos> Oh no Q_Q
02:37:06<Kita> She gets excited about small animals.
02:37:11<Kita> Mice, rabbits, moles...
02:37:24<Kita> Her little play yard is filled with digging...
02:37:33<Kita> Kita has a mole problem.
02:37:39<Laevos> Eeep @_@
02:38:08<Kita> But they like her yard dirt... Because she digs, and makes it softer to work with
02:38:22<Laevos> ;n;
02:38:49<Kita> She's a good girl, though...
02:39:00<Kita> Just, small, furry, squeakers set her off.
02:39:08<Laevos> Mhm ;n;
02:39:27<Kita> It's normal.
02:41:57 Laevos: nodnods

20:31:28<Kita> Okay
20:31:39<Kita> So the Game Grumps created two characters.
20:32:02<Kita> Not serious, and only because they were just goofing off off-camera
20:33:48<Kita> One is a guy who plays bass in a band, and is a member of the Ku Klux Klan, Racist Bassist... And he just cracks REALLY awkward and strange racist jokes that are just so odd and forced, because neither Grump is racist, that it is just awkward funny
20:34:18<Kita> And the other guy is Bummer Drummer, who says REALLY depressing shit, and plays drums for Racist Bassist.
20:34:31<Kita> Who is the only guy who can tolerate his depressing shit.

22:11:56 Kita: offers catnip
22:12:19<Laevos> Winners don't do drugs (except for those times where they do), and neither do I!
22:12:28<Laevos> Thanks though ;P
22:12:34<Laevos> Doing a reading for my WGSS class
22:12:40<Laevos> writing down all of the problems I have with it >_>
22:13:03<Kita> X3
22:13:09<Laevos> It's difficult because
22:13:14<Laevos> a lot of what it says is true
22:13:26<Laevos> we do live in a culture that oppresses larger bodies
22:13:41<Laevos> but you shouldn't, in the same sentences where you express that, call smaller bodies /waifs/
22:13:46<Laevos> that is 100% not okay
22:13:56<Kita> :<
22:15:13<Laevos> other problems so far
22:15:29<Laevos> implication t hat smaller bodies are inherently weaker/that all smaller women are inherently oppressing themselves
22:16:01<Laevos> oversimplification fo the cosmetic industry as merely (and entirely) an exploitation of women's self-consciousness/self-hatred
22:18:42<Kita> :<
22:19:03<Laevos> Is okay
22:19:14<Laevos> I get to criticize it tomorrow and Friday
22:19:36<Kita> Alright
22:19:53<Laevos> in class and stuff
22:19:57<Laevos> anyway
22:19:59<Laevos> what's Kita up to? o:
22:20:36<Kita> Watching DEATH BATTLE! episodes.
22:20:36<Kita> :3
22:20:55<Laevos> DEATH BATTLE!
22:20:57<Laevos> sounds classy
22:20:58<Laevos> ;)
22:21:34<Kita> (They take two characters from video games or TV, and pit them against eachother in a battle to the death, with the outcome decided by objective catergorisation of their weapons, armour, skills, and personalities.)
22:21:46<Laevos> Oh okay
22:21:58<Laevos> so Greatest Warrior (or whatever the heck it's called) but for vidya
22:22:05<Kita> Except...
22:22:09<Laevos> xcpt
22:22:13<Kita> These two are actually much, much better.
22:22:18<Laevos> o::::::::
22:22:46<Kita> Deadliest Warrior basically amounted to "Which side is closer to American cultural ideals? That one wins."
22:22:55<Laevos> Hahaha
22:22:57<Laevos> I don't doubt it
22:23:05<Kita> DEATH BATTLE! attempts to be as objective as they can possibly be.
22:23:25<Kita> Wizard and Boomstick are actually BOTH very analytical and VERY detailed.
22:23:34<Laevos> :3 That's good
22:23:59<Kita> (Wizard likes statistics, Boomstick likes the mechanics of weaponry, but is portrayed as less intelligent, despite being VERY intelligent.)
22:25:50<Kita> Tails
22:26:34<Kita> Reprogrammed a super computer using dish detergent and a toothpick
22:26:34 Kita: explodes.
22:30:55<Kita> (Yes, that is canon)
22:31:09<Laevos> Duh
22:31:25<Kita> DISH DETERGENT AND A TOOTHPICK
22:31:26<Kita> D:
22:31:29<Kita> HOOOOW
22:31:31<Laevos> HE'S MILES
22:31:38<Kita> MOTHER FUCKING PROWER
22:31:47<Laevos> AKA TAILS
22:32:03<Kita> THE GOD DAMN FOX
22:32:42<Laevos> THE JOKE IS HE HAS MULTIPLE TAILS
22:32:46<Laevos> LOOK IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY YOU CAN SEE
22:32:52<Kita> Also
22:33:01<Kita> Not only does Mario lose to Sonic
22:33:08<Kita> Luigi loses to Tails.
22:33:15<Laevos> I like Super Mayro, too
22:35:59<Kita> The fanboys are pissed about Luigi VS Tails.
22:36:36<Kita> They bring up the Negative Zone (Luigi's final Smash) which causes tripping, and random effects when you are on the ground from having been tripped
22:36:49<Kita> So Tails? He flies. So he can't trip.
22:36:56<Laevos> I dunno
22:37:00<Laevos> I can fly and I trip all the time
22:37:03<Kita> And the nerdlings outcry in agony.
22:38:33<Laevos> Awww
22:38:53<Laevos> I find 'canon fights' like that to be the height of sillyness
22:38:57<Laevos> but whatever you enjoy xD
22:39:16<Kita> They are just upset that someone beat the Negative Zone without being a Smash character.
22:39:16<Kita> Kirby can do the same thing
22:39:18<Kita> They are silly!
22:39:29<Kita> But DEATH BATTLE! does them very well!
22:39:49<Kita> They have decent production value, and they put out videos at a good pace
22:44:36<Kita> Ivy VS Orchid, make only three jokes about Ivy's RIDICULOUSLY endowed, back-breaking bosoms.
22:44:42<Kita> Just three!
22:44:50<Laevos> Yeah yeah :P
22:44:52<Laevos> Ivy's cool
22:45:00<Kita> Ivy IS cool.
22:45:03<Laevos> really difficult to play as for me though
22:45:08<Kita> One of Kita's favourite SC playstyles.
22:45:14<Laevos> but if any character should be focused on for their sex appeal
22:45:16<Laevos> it's Voldo
22:45:17<Laevos> I mean come on
22:45:22<Laevos> unf ;3

12:35:48<Laevos> I really likes Tales of Symphonia

12:37:15<Laevos> Ohhh, I get it
12:38:01<Laevos> because it's a collective, each individual noleg (whatever that is) being part of the greater mass of nolegs.
12:38:14<Kita> ?

12:38:32<Kita> No
12:38:33<Laevos> Cx
12:38:39<Kita> He just doesn't have legs, silly
12:38:50<Laevos> That's way less funny ;n;
12:39:24<Laevos> I can't even remember the last time I didn't have legs
12:39:31<Laevos> I'm sure it was traumatic, though
12:40:13<Kita> NoLegs has always been without legs.
12:40:18<Kita> He doesn't seem to mind.
12:40:32<Laevos> Oh, okay
12:41:07<Kita> (There was an extremely advanced, technologically speaking, race of no-legged cats, in the series canon.)
12:42:18<Laevos> I wish I were a race of no-legged cats
12:42:31<Kita> o.O

21:41:07<Laevos> worked
21:41:07 Kita: sips on her glass.
21:41:12<Kita> Productive.

21:41:15<Laevos> went to an EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITY
21:41:19<Kita> Everything is going well?
21:41:25<Laevos> Yes ma'am! <3
21:41:40<Laevos> The activity also went well
21:41:48<Laevos> got a free book and museum tickets out of it >u>
21:41:48<Kita> See? You just got to stick with things and continue building towards your goals.
21:41:52 Kita: giggles.
21:42:06<Kita> Things do get better, and go well.
21:42:08 Laevos: sticks with Kita even though she's not a thing but a lovely being.
21:43:09<Kita> X3
21:43:48 Laevos: maybe even sticks TO Kita, as she's a goofox
21:43:58<Laevos> Sticky~ >u>

21:45:15<Kita> Explaining to someone that the Sonic series was never actually awful, but that it really just had two big, hyped up games that flopped.
21:45:39<Laevos> Ooh, good luck
21:45:41<Laevos> How's that going?
21:47:38<Kita> Eh.
21:48:07<Laevos> Stands to reason :/
21:48:20<Laevos> I've never played any of the oft-derided 'terrible' Sonic games
21:48:24<Laevos> so I have no opinion thereof
21:48:46<Laevos> Did really like the old ones, Adventure 2, Generations... so basically, every single one that I've played, :P

22:00:58<Laevos> it was a fun game

22:01:09<Kita> The voice-acting was bad.

21:29:39<Laevos> Awwwh... why? Dx

21:30:04 Kita: is almost to the E4, and has BOXES of Pokemon to evolve.

00:37:24<Laevos> and then we got invited to a channel with a bunch of trans* folks sharing selfies and whatnot
00:37:51<Kita> o.o
00:37:59<Laevos> reinforced the not-being-able-to-transition-myself thing
00:38:40<Kita> You are capable, but have chosen not to.
00:38:48<Kita> Which is okay, because it is your choice.
00:39:10<Laevos> http://scontent-b-dfw.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc3/t31.0-8/1063746_10201478558833749_1733540773_o.jpg This is the only picture we felt comfortable sharing there. Only response was 'neat', stands to reason, as we're not pretty
00:41:08<Laevos> It doesn't feel like a choice... it feels like something I couldn't possibly ever do @_@
00:42:20<Kita> It would be hard... But many people do it.
00:42:40<Laevos> it would be
00:42:42<Laevos> because
00:42:47<Laevos> we have no natural feminity to begin with
00:43:15<Laevos> even our face... it'd be the most obvious thing
00:43:53<Kita> You lack of stereotypically male muscle tissues and lack of body fat would make up for your lack of structural femininity in the end.
00:44:54<Laevos> I'll never be feminine...
00:45:02<Laevos> never pretty priestess for goddess...
00:46:53<Kita> That kind of negativity will only solidify the idea.

01:05:14<Kita> Sometimes the trans communities themselves can be...
01:05:17<Laevos> everyone was nice but...
01:05:24<Kita> Overwhelming to new trangender individuals.
01:05:27<Kita> Or triggering.
01:05:29<Laevos> I had no place being there
01:05:56<Laevos> pretty folks sharing pictures of one another
01:06:04<Laevos> I had absolutely no place being there.
01:06:09<Laevos> of themselves, even.
01:06:21 Kita: petpats.
01:06:36<Kita> You could be there, someday, if you decided it was what you really wanted.
01:07:00 Laevos: sighs
01:07:27<Laevos> I used to be more okay with how I looked
01:07:31<Laevos> until I realized I wasn't pretty
01:07:43<Kita> It is okay to not be pretty.
01:07:55<Laevos> the problem is
01:08:02<Laevos> I used to kind of think I was
01:08:16<Laevos> but others have taken every opportunity to disillusion me of that fantasy.
01:08:27<Kita> Kita shouldn't count.
01:08:36<Kita> Kita is slightly obsessive of her fetish.
01:08:57<Laevos> my self-esteem has a mind of its own
01:09:12<Kita> Everything Kita says or does has been skewed by her fetishual desires.
01:09:23<Laevos> a good deal of my self-worth comes from pleasing others
01:09:29<Laevos> the people I care about
01:09:38<Laevos> and if I'm not appealing to them... I'm doing something wrong
01:09:39<Laevos> I'm a bad person
01:09:57 Kita: shakes her head.
01:10:06<Kita> There are many different ways to be appealing.
01:11:02<Laevos> I want to look good to the people I care about too...
01:12:40<Kita> You can be a loving, kind, caring individual to them, and that would far more than make up for MAYBE not being a little more attractive, physically.
01:14:09<Laevos> maybe...
01:16:53<Laevos> but I want to be able to hold people that I care about
01:16:57<Laevos> physically
01:17:03<Laevos> hard to do if they're repulsed by me
01:17:11<Laevos> mew...
01:17:23<Kita> Very few people would be REPULSED by a person.
01:18:09<Laevos> unsightly...
01:18:39<Kita> Kita would allow Lilith to grovel and tend to her.
01:19:04<Kita> To groom her nails, help her bathe...
01:19:10<Kita> Feed her
01:19:41<Laevos> most merciful goddess...
01:20:33<Kita> This is no punishment. This is reward for being such a lovely servant.
01:20:49<Kita> Remember that.
01:20:57<Laevos> no, serving goddess could never be a punishment...
01:21:00<Kita> Serving Kita is a privelege.
01:21:34<Laevos> An honor...
01:21:58<Kita> Good girl.
01:22:10<Laevos> Th-Thank you ;///////;
01:22:25 Kita: offers her paw.
01:22:57 Laevos: curties low, taking it and kissing it in deferential submission
01:23:59 Kita: turns it over to reveal a chocolate truffle.

01:26:02<Kita> Emulation is the purest form of worship.

22:00:21<Laevos> Good evening~
22:00:29<Laevos> My dear and oh so wonderous goddess~
22:00:43<Laevos> I went on a walk earlier, it was very, very pleasant :3
22:00:59<Kita> That sounds alright.
22:01:06<Kita> Kita dislikes walking though. :P
22:01:29<Laevos> And now, I'm making myself some ricec, and narrating my typing as I reply to you, to make sure that it sounds at least somewhat natural.
22:01:44<Kita> o.o
22:01:49<Kita> Narrating?
22:01:50<Laevos> That's okay, walking isn't for everyone. My puppy certainly enjoys it, though, as do I!
22:01:59<Laevos> Indeed, er, that's correct!
22:02:16<Kita> Why?
22:02:55<Laevos> Proooooobably to fill the silence with something other than itself. There's nobody here but my puppy and me. So... it's a bit quiet otherwise. :c
22:03:20<Kita> Sweet puppy
22:03:54<Laevos> He's a cutie. All curled up and tired out from our walk earlier.

22:07:34<Laevos> A little sheltie :3
22:07:41<Laevos> And now my little brother and his friend are here o.o
22:07:54<Kita> o.o
22:08:06<Laevos> *Friends
22:08:08<Laevos> o.o
22:08:17<Laevos> Highschool seniors
22:08:19<Kita> O.o
22:08:24<Kita> Ew?
22:08:27<Laevos> Maybe a bit
22:08:33<Laevos> a little bit bro-ish
22:09:11<Laevos> My brother's okay though, I told him to let me know if he wanted me to leave if he was going to hav epeople over
22:09:14<Laevos> he said no, though
22:09:35<Laevos> I asked him that because one time I came over to pick something up and he was on the couch with a girl, very embarrassing for her, I bed x_x I left right away
22:10:08 Kita: petpats
22:15:07<Laevos> ;w;
22:15:25<Laevos> And now I'm reading the 2014 Annual Report of the Kansas Department of Transportation.
22:15:30<Kita> o.O
22:15:32<Kita> Why
22:15:58<Laevos> Well!
22:16:41<Laevos> As I was making rice, the phrase "Kansas Bureau of Cartography" popped into my head because I saw a map of Kansas City sitting by the phonebooks
22:16:49<Laevos> so I promptly went back to my computer to search for it
22:16:52<Laevos> I found two things:
22:17:27<Laevos> The Cartography Section of the Kansas Department of Revenue, and the Cartography/Geographic Information Systems page of the Kansas Department of Transportation
22:17:40<Laevos> on the latter, one of the links on the sidebar was "Publications & Reports" which I clicked on, in interest
22:17:56<Laevos> On the right-hand side, there's a list of annual reports, with appendicies
22:18:04<Laevos> I chose the most recent, with high-resolution scans, and opened it up!
22:18:07<Laevos> That's all o.o
22:19:01<Kita> And what is in these reports that makes them interesting...?
22:20:48<Laevos> I haven't gotten very far yet, that remains to be seen!
22:21:01<Kita> o.o
22:21:17 Kita: is baffled that that could possibly be interesting.
22:21:58<Laevos> It's so officioius o_o
22:22:01<Laevos> How could it not be? Dx
22:22:41<Kita> It sounds like reading court transcripts.
22:24:06<Laevos> No way, yo, this is so colorful
22:24:08<Laevos> AND LUSH
22:24:29<Kita> o.O
22:26:24<Laevos> Apparently Kansas has the nation's second best highway system in overall performance and efficiency ouo
22:27:28<Kita> How does a highway system perform
22:27:59<Laevos> Excellent question!
22:28:37<Kita> IT CAN'T TAP DANCE
22:28:44<Kita> IT DOESN'T HAVE SHOOOOOOES
22:29:43<Laevos> There are charts o:
22:29:57<Laevos> Some of the criteria are:
22:30:00<Kita> Charts of what
22:30:42<Laevos> Capital-bridge disbursements per mile, maintenance disbursements per mile, administrative disbursements per mile, total disbursements per mile, rural interstate percent poor condition, rural other principal arterial percent poor, urben interstate percent poor, urban interstate percent congested
22:30:56<Laevos> rural arterial percent narrow lanes, percent of deficient bridges, fatality rate, overall performance
22:32:02<Kita> o.o
22:32:15<Laevos> Kita asked!
22:32:20<Laevos> And lo, the answer was given! >u>
22:32:23<Kita> That sounds really boring, if you don't get hard-ons for road constructions.
22:32:28 Kita: wouldn't read it.
22:32:34<Kita> XP
22:33:38<Laevos> I don't have a hard-on
22:34:13 Kita: snickers.
22:34:16<Laevos> But but but! It's DATA, Kita! :C
22:36:07<Kita> So you have a hard-on for data?
22:36:33<Laevos> I don't have a hard-on! Jeeez
22:36:42<Kita> :P
22:36:51<Laevos> If you really want me to have one, I can, but I don't see how that'd be of any benefit to you!

22:45:38 Kita: sits on her lap.
22:45:59<Laevos> o.o
22:46:10<Laevos> Hi there, Kita!
22:48:32<Kita> Your goddess requests that her priestess tells Kita how pretty she.
22:50:20<Laevos> But of course, goddess! ^/////////^ Kita is so very beautiful, smooth and plentiful, so warm and comforting against her priestess! ^////^ Her curved, ample figure is so inviting, so pretty and luscious, always making her priestess eternally grateful when she can wrap around her and cuddle up to her wonderful goddess! <3
22:50:41<Kita> Mmm...
22:50:48 Kita: nibbles her ear.
22:51:03<Kita> Now tell her how much her priestess loves her
22:52:04 Laevos: blushes deeply, gasping out a bit~ "L-Lilith loves her goddess so much! She's eternally devoted to her, making sure her every need and want is taken care of, ever in service of her most beneovlent and caring goddess~ Kita's priestess is so much in love with her, so thankful to serve her~"
22:55:15 Kita: places a hand on Lilith's chest.
22:56:26 Laevos: shivers, lowering her eyes in deference, purring lovingly <3
22:58:59<Laevos> Lilith really does love her goddess so much... she is so good to her, always helping her and guiding her... Lilith loves you... <3
23:00:17Kita (~Kita@74-32-173-22.dr01.myck.or.frontiernet.net) has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
23:01:50<Kita> <3
23:02:16<Laevos> [22:56:26]  Laevos: shivers, lowering her eyes in deference, purring lovingly <3
23:02:16<Laevos> [22:58:59] <Laevos> Lilith really does love her goddess so much... she is so good to her, always helping her and guiding her... Lilith
23:02:16<Laevos>                     loves you... <3
23:02:40 Kita: squeaks.
23:02:43<Kita> Eyes burn.
23:02:50<Laevos> Oh no... Dx Need to close them? ;n;
23:03:01 Kita: got an eyelash in her eye.
23:03:02<Kita> x.x
23:03:31<Laevos> Oh gosh x_____x that's the worst ;-;
23:04:11 Kita: was having her hair braided, too.
23:04:41<Laevos> Mrow ;~;
23:05:47 Kita: licks.
23:05:56 Laevos: licks the lick and nuzzles Kitaface
23:06:42 Kita: growls at her computer.
23:06:56<Laevos> ;n; Mew?
23:07:17<Kita> Not wanting to co-operate
23:07:23<Laevos> Eep Dx
23:11:25<Kita> Tomorrow is 4/13
23:11:28<Kita> Homestuck Day
23:12:42<Laevos> And a week after that is 4/20
23:12:45<Laevos> Jesus & Weed Day
23:13:56<Kita> Fuck Jesus. And... 4/20 was originally used as a communication tool for stoner meet ups.
23:14:11<Kita> It was, in its conception, 4:20 PM.
23:14:33<Kita> And referred to the time between 3rd and 4th lecture at a specific college.
23:15:00<Laevos> Jesus, Weed, Hitler & Columbine Day, then
23:15:19<Kita> In which the resource officers/school-oriented mall cops would shift shifts...
23:17:12<Laevos> Oh, okay
23:17:25<Kita> Basically...
23:17:28<Laevos> And, as for fucking Jesus... maybe
23:17:31<Kita> It was really clever and thought out...
23:17:36<Laevos> do you think he'd be a bottom?
23:17:39<Kita> Jesus is dumb.
23:17:47<Kita> He probably didn't actually exist.
23:17:52<Laevos> Is that a yes?
23:17:55<Kita> No.
23:18:03<Laevos> Hmm
23:18:06<Kita> Too pretentious... Thinking he is the son of god and all.
23:18:07<Laevos> I can't see him as much of a top though
23:18:10<Laevos> Hahaha
23:18:18<Laevos> Bottoms are stuck-up a lot, though
23:18:46<Laevos> 4 real
23:19:05 Kita: is a bottom.
23:19:18<Laevos> Kita has a bottom, too!
23:19:20<Laevos> It sounds lovely :3
23:19:59<Laevos> Kita's not stuck up... as far as Lilith is concerned!
23:20:35<Kita> XP
23:21:01<Laevos> Lilith is a switch
23:21:04<Laevos> whatever's required of her!
23:21:24 Kita: blinks...
23:21:30<Laevos> Definitely prefer being submissive, though
23:21:32 Kita: just... forgot what she was doing.
23:21:34<Laevos> serving her goddess >u>
23:21:36<Laevos> oh o-o
23:21:42<Laevos> It's okay, happens to me, too QnQ
23:26:14<Kita> Poorly done fake facial hair on Drag Kings and girlscosplayingguys irritates Kita.
23:26:24<Kita> Facial hair has a VERY definitive look.
23:26:33<Kita> It is VERY obvious when it is fake.
23:27:11<Laevos> Yes o.o
23:27:18 Laevos: has facial hair when she's not vigilant
23:27:23<Laevos> not very much, but
23:27:24<Laevos> y'know
23:27:25<Laevos> stubble
23:27:34<Kita> And it has a LOOK
23:28:00<Laevos> Lilith promises never to cosplay a guy or do fake facial hair on herself o.o
23:28:32<Kita> :P
23:28:45<Laevos> Promises!
23:28:52<Kita> Cosplaying a guy is fine, if you can do good stubble/good facial hair work.
23:28:57<Kita> You can GROW a beard.
23:29:03<Laevos> Gross
23:29:09<Kita> Stubble/Facial hair work is not hard for you.
23:29:09<Kita> :P
23:29:15<Laevos> It's hard on my emotions
23:29:17<Laevos> because it feels
23:29:18<Laevos> so gross
23:29:25<Kita> Kita is sure it is.
23:29:25<Kita> :<
23:29:34<Laevos> it's so itchy
23:29:44<Laevos> don't make me come out there, forget to shave for a day and RUB MY FACE ON YOU
23:30:16<Laevos> What's that? You want to have some nuzzles? Well now they're going to be SANDPAPER, sorry ;n;
23:30:18<Laevos> but yeah
23:30:19<Laevos> you get the idea
23:31:34<Kita> :<
23:31:37<Kita> Silly kitty
23:31:40<Kita> Shaving is easy
23:31:46<Laevos> It is
23:31:47<Laevos> and we do it
23:31:47 Kita: points to her legs.
23:31:56<Laevos> we should try to shave our body
23:32:08<Laevos> be all smooth and such
23:33:01<Laevos> Lilith would look like a twink @_@
23:33:03<Laevos> emaciated!
23:33:33<Kita> That can be rectified.
23:33:58<Laevos> Lilith can stuff her bra with those chicken filets
23:34:02<Laevos> fillets
23:35:11<Kita> o.o
23:35:39<Laevos> You know
23:35:40<Laevos> those little
23:35:40<Laevos> things
23:36:21<Laevos> these: http://www.eachbuyer.com/chicken-fillets-silicone-breast-enhancer-bra-insert-pad-p5254.html
23:38:19<Kita> Oh
23:38:38<Laevos> They look like chicken fillets... kind of >_>

23:47:10<Laevos> Orrrr
23:47:10<Laevos> or
23:47:19<Laevos> Kita can make Lilith all chubby
23:47:27<Kita> XP
23:47:35<Laevos> If she can o.o
23:49:09<Kita> XP
23:49:19 Kita: can. She is awesome at diet planning.
23:49:31<Laevos> Will Lilith have to move around less?
23:49:41<Laevos> Lilith paces like... all the time
23:49:48<Laevos> especially when talking to others
23:49:52<Laevos> hard to sit still and talk
23:50:36<Kita> Kita would create a reason for her to sit.
23:50:53<Laevos> @_@
23:50:55<Laevos> Yes ma'am!
23:51:02<Kita> ...
23:51:09<Kita> Thread on reddit...
23:51:15<Laevos> Uh-huh? o:
23:51:45<Kita> "Hey. I'm gay AND Christian. Any other gay Christians here? Also: No discussing ANYTHING negative about our faith."
23:51:54<Laevos> Hahaha, gross
23:52:02<Laevos> That's literally the grossest thing ever
23:52:04<Laevos> LITERALLY
23:52:33<Kita> You can be gay and Christian. You SHOULDN'T be Christian if you are gay, though.
23:52:59<Kita> Because the fundamentalist faithful are very focused on the expulsion of the LGBT.
23:53:40<Laevos> Yeah
23:53:44<Laevos> and other repugnant things
23:54:18<Kita> "Religious moderates" are ALSO a contradiction.
23:54:28<Kita> They actively defy their doctrine.
23:54:44<Laevos> drep de kristne
23:54:49<Laevos> (is the name of an album)
23:55:04<Kita> Kita would rather have them be crazy fundamentalists than half-assed, "because it is easier to not think about it" religious idiots.
23:55:35<Laevos> (It means 'kill the Christians')
23:55:51<Kita> Kita doesn't think we should kill them...
23:56:01<Laevos> Neither do I
23:56:04<Kita> But actively shunning them and pretending they don't exist?
23:56:07<Laevos> but that's what black metal's a lot about
23:56:16<Laevos> killing Christians and burning down churches
23:56:21<Kita> OR
23:56:27<Laevos> that's like one of the main tenements of the genre
23:56:30<Kita> White power, Satanist worship.
23:56:33<Laevos> that too
23:56:33<Kita> :P
23:56:39<Laevos> but that's a cheap bastardization
23:57:08 Kita: would be deemed a target by most racist organisations, for being half-Asian.
23:57:22<Laevos> What about Asian racist organizations?
23:57:38<Kita> Kita is half-white.
23:57:49<Laevos> well
23:57:50<Laevos> :c
23:58:08<Laevos> It's probably good to be hated by racists
23:58:13<Laevos> like
23:58:15<Laevos> if you aren't
23:58:18<Laevos> you're probably doing something wrong
23:58:31<Laevos> with your life
23:58:36<Kita> However
23:58:41<Kita> Kita does have one problem.
23:58:46<Laevos> What's that?
23:59:26 Kita: does not find most women of African, Indian, or Middle Eastern descent attractive, at all.
23:59:48<Kita> And that "most" is probably an "all", but Kita has not seen every woman of those categories.
23:59:52<Laevos> I think it's... okay to not find people attractive based on how they look
23:59:56<Laevos> like
--- Day changed Sun Apr 13 2014
00:00:05<Kita> Yeah...
00:00:10<Laevos> some people think it's not
00:00:11<Kita> It has to do with the darker skin.
00:00:20<Laevos> some people would say you're like
00:00:25<Laevos> horrible
00:00:28<Laevos> but I don't think so
00:00:47 Kita: is completely turned off by dark skin tones. Can't get it on with tanned girls, either.
00:02:07<Laevos> Lilith's kind of pale
00:03:10<Kita> Pale is best.
00:03:31<Kita> But noses and eyebrows mess with Kita's sexcycle, too.
00:04:00<Laevos> like... people having noses and eyebrows?
00:04:19<Kita> No.
00:04:33<Kita> Disproportionate noses, and uncared for eyebrows.
00:04:37<Kita> http://trending.ly/entertainment/13-hypnotizing-gifs-that-show-how-everyday-things-are-made/this-is-how-a-camo-helmet-gets-dyed/MRlBoC--z-adNRvWfBDUmQ/this-is-how-a-camo-helmet-gets-dyed.gif
00:05:04<Laevos> Oh okay
00:06:54<Laevos> I see o.o
00:07:15<Kita> That is fucking amazing.
00:08:23<Laevos> My brother's friends are being noisy
00:09:00<Laevos> I think they're going to go off and have sex with their classmates, though
00:09:10<Kita> Let Kita give Lilith a fact to alleviate this.
00:09:51<Kita> For the next seven days, every date, when written in standard American format (X/XX/XX), will be the same date, if you wrote it backwards.
00:10:01<Kita> Palindrome dates.
00:10:06<Laevos> That's good
00:10:08<Laevos> xD
00:10:11<Kita> Doesn't happen often enough.
00:10:22<Laevos> Hmm
00:10:26<Laevos> I should ask them if they have condoms
00:10:36<Kita> Do it
00:10:41<Kita> Or Birth Control pills.
00:11:06<Laevos> Outpatient vascetomies :3
00:11:23<Kita> XP
00:11:42<Laevos> Lilith wants to get a vascetomy if she doesn't get full on vaginoplasty
00:12:26<Kita> There was a micronation that claimed ownership of the entire universe
00:12:32<Kita> It called itself Celestia
00:12:35<Kita> Here is the flag.
00:12:39<Laevos> I saw that actually
00:12:42<Laevos> beautiful
00:12:42<Kita> http://i.imgur.com/rsDX94u.jpg
00:12:56<Laevos> Octothorpe
00:13:33 Kita: prefers the tilde and ampersand.
00:13:41<Laevos> I do like tildes...
00:13:44<Laevos> ~
00:13:46<Laevos> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
00:13:55<Laevos> They have so many utilities
00:14:13<Laevos> Facetious marker~
00:14:14<Kita> ~100, actually.
00:14:15<Laevos> Cuteness marker~!
00:14:31<Laevos> Let's fuck marker~
00:14:42<Laevos> Yeah, approximation, too
00:15:56<Kita> http://i.imgur.com/dvys9Re.jpg
00:16:08<Kita> That is an AR-15, which was assembled in New York.
00:16:22<Laevos> There's not a single god-damned tilde in that picture
00:16:23<Laevos> NOT RELEVANT
00:16:30<Kita> It is ILLEGAL to own an AR-15, OF ANY DESIGN, in New York~
00:16:42<Laevos> That's good
00:17:16<Kita> Kita's opinions on guns: Anti-gun laws would be great, if criminals actually gave a fuck about obeying laws.
00:17:39<Kita> The easiest way to protect yourself from a gun-wielding psychopath is a fucking gun.
00:17:54 Laevos: vomits on Kita :c
00:17:55<Laevos> Sowwie
00:18:30<Kita> Kita can say, as a targeted minority, that while she would never wish to harm someone, intentionally...
00:18:40<Laevos> I can't be around guns
00:18:44<Laevos> I can't be around people with guns
00:18:48<Laevos> it is absolutely terrifying
00:19:33<Kita> That everyone who would view Kita as evil, for no reason, probably owns a gun.
00:19:59<Kita> There are two counters for guns. Bullet proof armour, and another gun.
00:20:01<Laevos> I can't...
00:20:03<Laevos> I can't do it...
00:20:05<Laevos> I'm sorry Kita...
00:20:11<Kita> You never have to see it.
00:20:17<Kita> And Kita won't talk about it.
00:20:50<Kita> But Kita likes her life too much to give people who want to take it ANY advantage over her, were it to come to them versus her to the death.
00:21:03<Kita> That is why she doesn't have to worry about Lilith.
00:21:09<Kita> Lilith would never hurt Kita.
00:21:24<Kita> As a result, Kita would never have a reason to hurt Lilith.
00:21:31<Laevos> Lilith might be shaking the whole time...
00:21:58<Kita> You'd never be in the same room as it.
00:22:10<Kita> Easily kept promise.
00:22:31 Laevos: sighs...
00:22:37<Laevos> Lilith trusts Kita
00:22:44<Kita> Good girl.
00:22:54<Kita> Just remember.
00:23:02<Kita> To Kita? The gun isn't a sword. It is a shield.
00:23:08<Laevos> she isn't, however, really able to control her phobia...
00:23:15<Kita> Sure
00:23:18<Kita> But SOMETIMES
00:23:29<Kita> Having a piece of reason...
00:23:33<Kita> Something repeatable...
00:23:37<Kita> Can help calm phobia.
00:24:17<Kita> Kita repeats to herself the speed at which an object breaks the sound barrier, when thunder is around.
00:25:06<Laevos> Perhaps that'd be good ;n;
00:25:38<Kita> So
00:26:15<Kita> Find a repeatable phrase related to Lilith's safety.
00:26:28<Kita> Turn it into the mantra of your phobia attacks.
00:26:42<Kita> The way to calm yourself and focus yourself into your center.
00:26:42<Laevos> Okay <3
00:26:53<Laevos> Might involve clinging to you and whimpering "I love you"
00:26:59<Laevos> that is not unheard of
00:26:59<Kita> X3
00:27:07<Laevos> for me >_>
00:27:18<Kita> XP
00:27:36<Laevos> so if Kita's okay with that possibility
00:27:44<Laevos> then Lilith can probably be okay
00:28:51<Kita> Nippon Airlines puts origami Pokemon on children's plane tickets.
00:29:02<Laevos> Yes :3

20:53:37<Kita> :<
20:54:15<Laevos> Going to get tested on Tuesday
20:54:30<Kita> Oh. Tested for what?
20:55:17<Laevos> Mew. For STIs. Might have shown a symptom today but I'm not sure. Going to get tested just in case.
20:55:36<Kita> Good girl.
20:55:48<Laevos> am terrified
20:55:53<Laevos> have been unable to do anything today x_x
20:58:32 Kita: petpats.
20:58:41<Kita> Hey look...
20:59:06<Kita> The worst it could be is HIV or Lycanthropy.
21:00:04<Laevos> What I thought was happening wasn't a symptom of either of those, if it's anything, it'd be gonorrhea
21:00:20<Kita> That is manageable.
21:03:27<Laevos> I feel so scared
21:03:29<Laevos> and dirty
21:03:38<Laevos> I should never touch anyone ever agian...

21:13:49<Laevos> I might have just had to go to the bathroom
21:13:52<Kita> o.o
21:14:02<Kita> o.O
21:14:24<Laevos> well I noticed that there was
21:14:30<Laevos> a damp spot on my shorts
21:14:59<Laevos> against where my urethra was... and the first thing that I thought was it was some kind of discharge so I looked it up
21:15:27<Laevos> and the most common cause of an unknown discharge is an STI... so I panicked...
21:17:09<Kita> When was this?
21:17:39<Laevos> earlier today
21:17:50<Laevos> I was spacing out before I noticed it
21:17:51<Kita> Like...
21:17:55<Kita> Oh.
21:20:36<Laevos> mew...
21:21:23<Kita> Do you want to see a Hawk Luchador to make you feel better?
21:21:36<Laevos> A what...?
21:21:42<Kita> YEs.
21:21:50<Kita> A Hawk, Mexican ring wrestler.
21:21:56<Laevos> Hawk as in
21:22:07<Laevos> Hawk & Dove, the DC superheroes?
21:22:09<Kita> A bird

21:23:23<Laevos> really cute ;-;
21:23:29<Laevos> what terrifies me the most is
21:23:31<Laevos> well
21:23:33<Laevos> not the most
21:23:37<Laevos> but something that also terrifies me is
21:23:45<Laevos> to get tested... I'll probably have to get my blood drawn
21:23:49<Laevos> which means a needle
21:25:23<Kita> take a blindfold.

23:54:35<Laevos> Yessssssss xux
23:55:08<Kita> The "master race" joke is an adaptation of "Grass-type Master Race"
23:55:23<Kita> Which was what the Bulbasaur pickers called themselves.
23:55:43<Laevos> Did they? :cc
23:55:50<Kita> Yes.
23:56:01<Kita> Because between Blastoise, Charizard, and Venusaur...
23:56:21<Kita> Charizard was the most popular, Blastoise was the best battler, and Venusaur just made the game easier.
23:58:11<Laevos> xD
23:58:50<Kita> But

01:00:29<Kita> Supposedly...
01:00:41<Kita> Every trainer has a "technique" for catching a Pokemon.
01:01:06<Kita> Some press Down + B
01:01:46<Kita> Some rapidly tap A.
01:04:05<Kita> Kita uses Capture Power Level 3 and a Quick Ball, or Capture Power Level 3, Paralysis, and a proper HP reduction.

00:47:04<Kita> Pokemon, as of Gen III, have abilities.

00:47:18<Kita> Wonder Skin is an ability Sigilyph can have.
00:47:36<Laevos> That works for curse, too? x_x

00:48:05<Laevos> ah, okay
00:48:06<Kita> They can be poisoned, burned, paralyzed, and frozen...
00:48:10<Kita> Actually
00:48:19<Kita> They can't be frozen or paralyzed.

01:15:03<Kita> Mega-Gengar ends most battles.
01:15:16<Kita> Getting to Mistress is a good indicator of your skill.
01:15:38<Kita> And Mistress is a cheap bitch, and why Kita abandoned the Ghost team for the Steel team.
01:15:55<Laevos> I'm shit at Pokemon and always will be, so
01:16:03<Laevos> it's better that I remembered that sooner rather than later
01:16:13<Kita> Actually, you're good, just unfamiliar with the current meta game.
01:16:22<Kita> Kita could teach Lilith, and Lilith would be VERY good.
01:16:24<Laevos> don't have time to catch up x_x

01:20:51 Kita: pets softly.
01:20:58<Laevos> ...and calling me baby ;///////;
01:21:11<Kita> When Lilith feels better, she'll teach Lilith how to be as awesome as Kita.
01:21:12<Kita> :3
01:21:20<Laevos> Yes ma'am~ <3
01:22:16<Laevos> Lilith loves her Goddess lots, and is sorry for being so emotional x~x
01:22:21<Kita> <e3
01:22:23<Kita> <3*
01:22:40<Laevos> <3
01:22:47<Laevos> Love you ;/////////;
01:24:43<Laevos> Does Kita sing?
01:24:48<Kita> Yush
01:25:54<Laevos> Okay
01:25:58<Laevos> it'd be totally cool if
01:26:05<Laevos> Kita sang Lilith a lullaby sometime ^^
01:26:09<Kita> X3
01:26:35<Laevos> It would!
01:26:39<Laevos> But if Kita doesn't want to, that's okay
01:29:43<Kita> Kita is eh...
01:29:50<Kita> Afraid of recording equipment.
01:29:53<Kita> It is triggering
01:31:02<Laevos> Okay, nevermind, then <3
01:31:20<Laevos> Lilith understands triggers x_x
01:31:47<Laevos> She has another question, though! How Goddess manages to put up with her Priestess ._.

02:08:19<Laevos> Cool moon xux
02:11:48<Kita> X3
02:12:41<Kita> Kita manages to put up with her Priestess, because caring for such a loving servant is not something she has to put up with. She enjoys Lilith's compant.
02:12:45<Kita> company*
02:12:52<Laevos> Awwwww ^/////////^
02:12:57<Laevos> Kita is AMAZING
02:13:02<Kita> <3
02:13:05<Laevos> <3 Best Goddess ever
02:13:14<Kita> Damn straight.
02:14:09<Laevos> Lilith is a very lucky Priestess to serve her! <3
02:15:24 Laevos: snuggles up to and paws at lovingly <3
02:16:30<Kita> <3
02:16:33<Kita> Silly kitty
02:16:58<Laevos> Hungry kitty xwx
02:17:04<Kita> Oh yeah?
02:17:36<Laevos> Mhm! ;n; Kitty needs to be fed to grow up big and pretty like Kita <3
02:18:22<Kita> What if Kita just... transferred some of her fat to Lilith?
02:18:47<Laevos> Mmh... That would be really nice... x////////x
02:19:32<Kita> Half of everything Kita gains will go to her Priestess
02:21:52<Laevos> O-Oh my... Kita is such a generous Goddess... <3
02:22:39 Kita: rubrubs her kitty's chin
02:22:53 Laevos: purrs loudly, licking Kita's face <3
02:23:05 Kita: knows how uncomfortable gorging is for Lilith.
02:23:10<Laevos> I wanna be nice and soft and lovely to the touch...
02:23:41<Laevos> Thank you for being so understanding... ;/////////; I want to be more comfortable...
02:23:52<Kita> <3
02:25:49<Laevos> And I wanna be a smexy Priestess for you... ;/////;
02:26:02 Kita: kisses her nose.
02:27:14 Laevos: blushes and nuzzles up to
02:27:34<Laevos> Kita's got me all flustered Q////Q
02:29:40 Kita: rubs on her ears
02:30:07 Laevos: Mmmmmmmprrrrs~ goes kinda limp blissfulkitty at the touch <3
02:30:25<Laevos> L-Love you~~ :'3
02:31:35<Kita> Love you, too, baby.
02:33:36<Laevos> Lilith's in bed now, feels really warm and cuddled (hopefully not just warm from the fever). Amazing Kita <3 best Goddess, best. Lilith loves being Kita's friend, Priestess, worshipper, baby~ =^u^=
02:36:45 Kita: chirps at.

01:18:51<Laevos> Kita's probably the most wonderful ever. Thank you for all of your advice and playing and general Supreme-Being-of-the-Universeness. How much? It feels like my heart could burst forth with enough pulsing, liquid adoration to fill the contents of as many oceans as there are bits of data stored in the whole of human systems <3 All rushing forth from Lilith's chest and focusing into a single point that's just for Kita <333
01:19:25<Kita> D'awwww...
01:19:40<Kita> Kita feels more powerful, just from reading that.
01:20:06<Laevos> Good! :3 If Goddess is secretly feeding off of my love and life-force to strengthen her power, that's fine <3
01:20:14<Kita> X3
01:20:31<Laevos> Lilith likes pouring forth her admiration and love and affection forth into her Goddess~! <3
01:23:22 Kita: rubrubs her ears.
01:23:32 Laevos: purrs loudly <3<3
01:24:18<Laevos> Ooh
01:24:38<Laevos> Proof of Lilith's love for Kita: If she agreed to join her for it, Lilith would...
01:24:41<Laevos> give...
01:24:45<Laevos> Gurren Lagaan another chance...
01:24:56<Laevos> Don't tell anyone >_>
01:25:01 Kita: snickers.
01:25:09<Kita> That could be a serious mistake.
01:25:10<Kita> :P
01:25:19<Kita> You COULD end up LOVING it.
01:25:26<Laevos> I know
01:25:38<Laevos> And who would I be willing to risk that for?
01:25:38<Laevos> JUST YOU
01:25:42<Laevos> so take that ;w;
01:26:46 Kita: kisses her nose.
01:27:14 Laevos: blushes and curtsies politely~ <3
01:27:35<Kita> Such pretty kitty priestess.
01:28:24<Laevos> Mmhhh... the ultimate incarnation of beauty upon the world should probably have pretty kitty priestesses, at the very least! <3
01:28:35<Kita> X3
01:30:47<Laevos> Lilith really does hope to be able to spend time with her Goddess someday... no matter how long it takes <3 And even if it involves watching anime that she said she wouldn
01:30:48<Laevos> 't
01:33:06<Laevos> Someday, perhaps... <3 The thought makes Lilith's eyes water all happily
01:33:22 Kita: pats her lap.
01:33:43 Laevos: curls up in her lap, snuggling up and purring contentedly

02:03:24<Kita> The new PBS series "Your Inner Fish" is awesome, by the way.
02:03:54<Laevos> That sounds... interesting O_O
02:03:56<Laevos> What's it like?
02:04:15<Kita> (It is about the Tiktaalik, and what it means in regards to the evolutionary development of our hands)
02:04:17<Laevos> Also, does Kita know anyone who actually plays the Pokemon TCG? What're your thoughts on it? o:
02:04:20<Laevos> Oh, okay :3
02:04:33<Kita> The Pokemon TCG...
02:04:36<Laevos> That does sound cool
02:04:37<Kita> Okay
02:04:58<Kita> Remember Yu-Gi-Oh?
02:05:03<Laevos> Yes
02:05:11<Laevos> (I played it a few times xux)
02:05:18<Kita> Remember the kind of people who were TOO into it?
02:05:35<Laevos> Erm... I know some people who are really into Magic: The Gatherin!
02:05:37<Laevos> *Gathering
02:05:49<Kita> Okay... Gonna get there in a second...
02:05:55<Laevos> Never knew any Yu-Gi-Oh superfans, though
02:05:59<Laevos> well... maybe they were and I just didn't know
02:06:05<Laevos> anyway, let's assume the answer is 'yes'
02:06:06<Kita> Well, people still play that game.
02:06:13<Laevos> Yeah, I've seen local tournaments and such
02:06:16<Kita> Now
02:06:18<Kita> Magic
02:06:45<Kita> Take everything about M:TG players that make them awful to be around, while they are talking about the game or playing it.
02:06:54<Laevos> My thoughts on M:TG is that it's fun but expen$$$ive to play competitively
02:06:57<Kita> Get rid of the anger, but keep the other stuff.
02:07:07<Laevos> and yeah, a fair amount of meh community
02:07:17<Kita> And then inject that into the YGO superfan people.
02:07:30<Kita> And change the obsession to Pokemon.
02:07:35<Laevos> xD
02:07:37<Laevos> Okay good
02:07:45<Laevos> because I always thought the card game was kind of terrible
02:07:48<Kita> The TCG community is corrosively toxic.
02:07:57<Laevos> Good to know O_O
02:08:06<Kita> And the game itself is just a modified M:TG clone.
02:08:15<Laevos> Not a very good one, at that :/
02:08:58<Laevos> It seemed like there were some Pokemon that were just straight-up useless
02:09:04<Laevos> that could never be viable... anywhere
02:09:11<Laevos> and I always thought that kind of sucked
02:09:27<Kita> Those have a name.
02:09:37<Kita> There are M:TG cards like that...
02:09:47<Kita> They are called "Booster Packers"
02:09:48<Laevos>  Yu-Gi-Oh at least let you use seemingly weak monsters in interesting ways
02:09:51<Laevos> Hehehe xD
02:10:06<Kita> Part of it...
02:10:24<Kita> You can't have 723 Pokemon and not have a card for some of them.
02:10:47<Laevos> Granted
02:10:53<Laevos> and I guess Sunflora still exists, so...
02:11:01<Laevos> :P
02:12:17<Kita> Okay
02:12:18<Laevos> Maybe it's a bit of a stretch to want every single Pokemon to have a potential use
02:12:19<Laevos> but I do
02:12:30<Kita> Sunflora is cool. Sunkern is not.
02:12:36<Laevos> Okay, fine xD
02:12:48<Kita> Sunflora has a purpose
02:12:53<Kita> Baton Pass setup
02:12:56<Laevos> Yay :3
02:13:05<Laevos> I mean fully-evolved ones, of course
02:13:15<Laevos> I'm fine with Magickarp just being a placeholder to wait for a Gyrados
02:13:55<Kita> Gyarados is now just a placeholder for MEGA GYARADOS~
02:15:09<Laevos> Also true xD
02:15:10<Kita> Unfortunately...
02:15:35<Kita> You don't get Mega Gyarados for a Mono-Dark...
02:15:46<Laevos> Is okay ;-;
02:15:53<Kita> To get to it, you have to have a non-Dark on your team.
02:16:08<Kita> Water/Flying =/= Dark ;.;
02:16:09<Laevos> Kind of want a Malamar
02:16:13<Laevos> Indeed ;-;
02:16:23<Kita> Malamar isn't very good.
02:16:29<Laevos> No? ;n;
02:16:39<Kita> Yeah... Is sad

03:06:31<Kita> Trying to create a damage engine for boss battles.
03:06:53<Laevos> How far have you gotten with that? o:
03:06:54<Kita> So that they can be either hit so many times or have hit points.
03:07:08<Kita> Never worked on boss battle stuff, yet.

03:11:01<Kita> Game backstory
03:11:35<Kita> The world is a small planet on the edge of the multiverse. It houses two supercontinents.
03:12:28<Kita> Because of the nature of the civilisations, The two groups on them never really interacted... They focused more on conquering their own harsh habitats and cultivating them.
03:12:48<Kita> One side turned to science to discover how the world's "magic" worked...
03:13:09<Kita> The other side turned using the world's magic to gain control over it.
03:13:29<Kita> The first two games that will come out of this engine will start on that continent.
03:14:04<Kita> In the first game...
03:14:42<Kita> An evil force begins kidnapping people from all over the continent, and combat robots keep popping up all over.
03:15:48<Kita> It is up to a benevolent necromancer and four knights from previously warring kingdoms to prevent their world from becoming a barren, robot-spawning wasteland.
03:16:26<Laevos> Ooh o:
03:16:30<Laevos> I wanna play ;n;
03:16:39<Kita> Second game...
03:17:14<Kita> Long after the first game... We come to two forest spirits frolicking in their long forgotten forest...
03:17:30<Kita> Kitsu and Dryka
03:18:24<Kita> They become separated in their game, only for Kitsu to spend the entire day looking for her lover/friend... And she finds her, collapsed with a fever.
03:19:43<Kita> She takes her to the only being they have ever known, a witch, holed up in the forest, far from the two large cities on the continent... She looks over the spirit, Dryka, and concludes that the death of magic will soon be upon them.
03:19:48<Laevos> Oh yes, I heard that one from you, but not the first one ;n;
03:19:54<Kita> Yeah.
03:19:54<Kita> :<
03:20:13<Kita> First game, more Metroidvania style gaming.
03:20:17<Laevos> They sound wonderful, though! Q_Q
03:20:39<Kita> Second game, exploratory, world-built platformer, a la Knytt or Knytt Stories.
03:21:34<Laevos> never played those, but sounds really great :3
03:22:02<Kita> Knytt and Within A Deep Forest are free and short.
03:22:16<Kita> Both were developed by Nifflas
03:22:48<Laevos> Oh okay
03:23:16<Kita> Very short. Very relaxing.
03:25:14<Laevos> Yay :3
03:26:37<Kita> Kita wants the second game to be very fun and relaxing, with intense, thinky boss fights.
03:26:45<Laevos> Ooh :3
03:26:54<Laevos> That would be amazing~ <3
03:28:37 Kita: has eaten too much cheesecake, today.
03:28:48<Laevos> Awww :c
03:28:54<Laevos> Feeling sick? Dx
03:29:03<Kita> No...
03:29:08<Kita> Just tired of the texture.
03:29:23<Kita> Had three cheesecakes for a thing tomorrow that got canceled.
03:29:26<Laevos> Ah okay
03:29:27<Laevos> :c
03:29:55<Kita> Made them ahead of time, but they would have gone bad if they waited for three or four more days..
03:30:02<Kita> So Kita ate all three of them, today.
03:30:05<Laevos> Q____Q Yes
03:30:57<Kita> One of Kita's bedbound flings cancelled on her.
03:30:57<Kita> :<
03:31:12<Kita> The immobile girls are the sexiest.
03:31:43<Kita> It is a shame when they cancel dates.
03:31:46<Laevos> Awww... ;n;
03:31:53<Laevos> That's never good
03:32:21<Kita> A lot of it is insecurity.
03:32:40<Laevos> Yeah... Q_Q
03:32:41<Kita> They get upset that Kita finds them pretty and wants to fuck them, because they don't think they are pretty.
03:33:03 Laevos: nodnods :c
03:33:18<Kita> Kita isn't like that, though.
03:33:29<Kita> Kita can't wait until her ass anchors her to a bed.
03:33:30<Kita> <3
03:33:50<Kita> So fat that her legs can't support her ass anymore
03:34:05<Laevos> :3
03:34:08<Laevos> Kita is so beautiful
03:34:16<Laevos> and will be more beautiful still~! <3
03:34:27<Kita> Kita only wants to grow
03:34:37<Kita> And make others grow.
03:34:58 Kita: is kind of just in love with fat.
03:35:31 Laevos: kisses Kita's fat o: <3
03:35:45<Kita> <3
03:36:42<Laevos> and if there's more of it
03:36:50<Laevos> then that just means Kita needs to be given more kisses :3
03:37:25<Kita> X3
03:37:47 Laevos: kisses Kita's booty xux
03:37:59 Kita: snickers
03:38:14 Laevos: mwah~!s >uu>
03:38:19<Laevos> You know you love it
03:38:28<Kita> also
03:38:32<Kita> Despite the fat...
03:38:46 Kita: lifts her foot up to rub the back of her own ear...
03:38:53<Laevos> That's so cute...
03:38:54<Kita> Still quite flexible.
03:39:11<Laevos> Goddess is too cute, I'm going to explode xwx
03:39:22 Kita: has always been quite limber.
03:39:37<Laevos> That's amazing :3
03:41:52 Kita: jingles the bell
03:42:22 Laevos: loves her jingly bell ^u^

16:20:24<Kita> How is it going?
16:20:30<Kita> Looking at a Mega Houndoom?
16:24:37<Laevos> Not yet
16:25:13<Kita> Whatcha looooookin
16:25:15<Kita> at
16:26:07<Laevos> Well
16:26:09<Laevos> the current team is
16:26:25<Laevos> Spiritomb, Scrafty, Liepard, Greninja, Tyranitar, Hydreigon
16:26:35<Laevos> (Mega) Tyranitar, I should say
16:26:49<Kita> IS the Greninja Protean?
16:26:54<Laevos> Yes
16:27:00<Kita> A'ite.
16:27:06<Kita> Suggestion
16:27:08<Laevos> Probably going to switch someone out
16:27:08<Laevos> for
16:27:14<Laevos> Bisharp
16:27:16<Laevos> because Bisharp
16:27:20<Kita> Hydreigon
16:27:25<Kita> It is 4x weak to Fairy
16:27:31<Laevos> Sounds good
16:27:33<Kita> Bisharp is a Fairy killer
16:28:40<Kita> Also, Physical Greninja is viable.
16:28:47<Laevos> Oh? o:
16:28:56<Laevos> Mine is not physical
16:29:39<Laevos> Hmm...
16:29:48<Laevos> is Magnet rise worth it for Bisharp or should I just give it a balloon?
16:31:33<Kita> Balloon could work
16:31:40<Kita> But...
16:31:48<Kita> The reason for Physical Greninja...
16:32:07 Kita: thinks Game Freak made a mistake in coding either Greninja or its signature move.
16:32:21<Kita> Water Shurikan is a physical move.
16:32:43<Kita> But it is priority, 2-5 hits.
16:32:56<Kita> Base power 30, I think.
16:32:59<Laevos> 15 it says
16:33:09<Kita> 15? Holy shit.
16:34:01<Laevos> Worth it, you think?
16:34:21<Laevos> right now its water move is hydro PAMP
16:36:00<Kita> Eh... Still is viable, but needs testing.
16:36:10<Laevos> Yeah
16:37:48<Kita> You're good with what you got.
16:38:00<Laevos> Okay :3

23:45:35<Laevos> What's Kita up to? o:
23:46:17<Kita> watching Criminal Minds
23:46:22 Kita: nuzzles and lickgrooms
23:46:26<Laevos> Ooh, is it wonderous?
23:46:36 Laevos: blushes and collapses and lickgrooms your lickgrooms
23:47:00<Kita> It is about a heavily embellished Behaviourial Analysis Unit working for the FBI, and how they stop psychopaths
23:47:48<Laevos> Delicious? :3
23:47:59<Kita> It is interesting...
23:48:06<Kita> Since Kita is a medicated psychopath.
23:48:24<Laevos> It sounds like something we wouldn't watch necessarily
23:48:27<Laevos> but interesting maybe
23:48:42<Kita> It has...
23:48:49<Kita> Moments of gore.
23:48:57<Kita> Because the psychopaths are killers.
23:49:00<Laevos> Yeah
23:49:25<Kita> But... it delves into questions of the human psyche
23:50:12<Kita> Though...
23:50:26<Kita> Sometimes the categorisation of people is considered a trigger.
23:50:42<Kita> And they are very much categorising unknown subjects.
23:50:45<Kita> BUT
23:50:50<Laevos> butts
23:51:23<Kita> That is the nature of tracking down psychopaths, sociopaths, psychotics, and the insane
23:51:29<Kita> Cool thing about the human brain
23:51:40<Kita> When it works, profiling doesn't work.
23:51:54<Laevos> :3
23:52:08<Kita> When it breaks, profiling is highly effective.
23:52:18<Laevos> Interesting ouo
23:52:41<Kita> A brain has to be broken to be compartmentalised, like that.
23:52:49<Kita> Brains break reliably.
23:52:50<Laevos> That is very cool
23:53:10<Kita> Schizophrenics all share one thing in common.
23:53:15<Kita> They hear voices.
23:53:30<Kita> The brain construction of schizophrenics is very similar.
23:53:34<Kita> Kita is an anomaly.
23:54:02<Laevos> Oh?
23:54:19<Kita> Kita's schizophrenia is actually two brains trying to work together. Unlike most chimeras, her brain is layered, like two books having their pages intertwined.
23:54:36<Laevos> Oh my @~@
23:54:43<Kita> Once that was figured out...
23:55:00<Kita> They just deadened her brain activity with some low-key drug doses...
23:55:30<Laevos> Yeah x_x
23:55:35<Kita> She feels like a normal person now... No longer like to people trapped behind glass, watching while someone fumbles at their conflicting instructions.
23:55:40<Kita> two*
23:55:52 Laevos: nodnods
23:56:08<Kita> Imagine that
23:56:34<Kita> Imagine that you and someone else were giving instructions to a person, but the instructions sometimes were different things...
23:56:43<Kita> And they got mixed by the person doing them.
23:56:52<Kita> So you started to get frustrated.
23:57:11<Kita> And started telling the person to do something to destroy the other decision maker
23:57:40<Laevos> Mew :c
23:58:02<Kita> But those instructions got muddled with everything
23:59:20<Kita> And the person started trying to do the things they were being told to do
23:59:30<Kita> Which was hurt someone while cutting a box open
23:59:49<Kita> Or kill someone while cooking a meal
--- Day changed Fri Apr 18 2014
00:00:22<Laevos> It sounds very difficult...
00:00:50<Kita> And then suddenly... two pills...
00:00:58<Kita> And the instruction makers disappear...
00:01:01<Kita> Leaving just you
00:02:36<Laevos> Just my lovely, lovely Goddess... whom I worship, serve, adore...
00:03:53<Kita> Who used to be homocidal
00:04:54<Laevos> and who is now my savior...
00:05:21<Kita> X3

00:49:43<Laevos> I'll see if the lyrics are EVEN POSTED
00:49:47<Laevos> I'm pretty sure it's like
00:49:54<Laevos> "trees are great"
00:49:57<Laevos> "omg moon so cool"
00:50:09<Kita> It is possibly...
00:50:32<Kita> "I like to crunch and munch on the spines of unborn babies, and then shit on their mothers."
00:50:34<Laevos> oh wait, lyrics have been posted
00:50:35<Kita> :P

00:52:16<Laevos> very n ew
00:52:20<Kita> That album cover is grainy as fuck.
00:52:20<Laevos> new
00:52:28<Laevos> their only album came out in 2013
00:52:35<Laevos> possibly a low-quality scan
00:52:40<Laevos> I could take a picture of my cover... sometime
00:52:42<Laevos> when I dig out the CD
00:53:06<Kita> I'm about to grind that picture up and bake it into bread, that shit is so grainy.

00:54:07<Kita> Where Month mourns Dawn of Snow Ghosts
00:54:16<Kita> Pffft...
00:54:27<Kita> This sounds like... Emo power metal.
00:54:33<Kita> the lyrics
00:54:40<Kita> Not the music
00:54:49<Laevos> It's nature omg
00:54:54<Laevos> Emo stuff doesn't know what nature is
00:55:06<Laevos> they just get broken up with via text messages
00:55:14<Kita> But Power Metal does.
00:55:19<Laevos> >u>
00:55:20<Kita> X3
00:55:22<Laevos> well
00:55:27<Laevos> it's certainly somewhat melancholy
00:55:29<Laevos> minor key, you know
00:55:36<Laevos> but at the same time...
00:55:39<Laevos> very uplifting in places
00:55:59 Kita: wants to hear a song that eclectically swaps between major/minor key
00:56:12<Kita> MOOD WHIPLASH
00:56:15<Kita> THE MUSICAL

00:57:04<Kita> You think this fat ass has the stamina to dance like a moron under hot lights?
00:57:20<Laevos> No dancing
00:57:27<Laevos> it'll be a pretty shit musical by modern standards
00:57:30<Kita> But that is part of a musical
00:57:31<Kita> XD
00:57:31<Laevos> but I'll just sing at you
00:57:45<Kita> Most musicals aren't very good.
00:58:00<Kita> Too focused on the story of the music, rather than the music.
00:58:10<Laevos> Then I'll be fitting well into the long-standing tradition ;3

01:04:39<Kita> XP
01:04:50<Laevos> Well
01:05:22<Laevos> it's at least better than the people who thought Chechnya and the Czech Republic were the same place
01:05:49<Kita> Wut
01:05:53<Kita> How
01:05:55<Kita> Why
01:05:57<Kita> No.
01:06:00<Kita> Not real.
01:06:02<Laevos> After the Boston marathon bombings, a bunch of people on Twitter were posting that we should invade the Czech Republic
01:06:04<Kita> Tits or GTFO
01:06:09 Laevos: pulls up her shirt o.o
01:06:16<Kita> You can stay.
01:06:30<Laevos> :3
01:06:37<Laevos> That really happened though
01:06:51<Laevos> Geography = not their strong suit
01:07:18 Laevos: undulates blissfully to this absolutely perfect section in this song
01:08:47<Laevos> A Nurów Krzyk Wiatr Na Skrzydłach Nocy Niesie... -> Perhaps Song of the 2013
01:09:02<Kita> Probably not.
01:09:07<Laevos> sassy
01:09:15<Kita> Reason for
01:09:43<Kita> It isn't in English, which more people speak than most other languages. It may not be the most common 1st language...
01:09:54<Laevos> what
01:09:58<Kita> But English is pretty much taught to everyone who doesn't speak it.
01:10:03<Laevos> I said best song
01:10:14<Laevos> not speakingest song!
01:10:14<Kita> Subjective title.
01:10:38<Kita> The best song is going to be the song that most people like. This is unfortunate, because most people are stupid.
01:10:50<Laevos> Yeah right
01:10:58<Laevos> the best song is whatever I say it is!!!
01:11:01<Kita> :P
01:11:07<Laevos> for me, anyway
01:11:18<Laevos> I don't like having to add that since it should be fairly BLOBVIOUS
01:11:53<Kita> :<
01:12:16<Laevos> If people want to talk about objective standards in entertainment, I'm generally not like
01:12:18<Laevos> too interested
01:14:20<Kita> That is unfortunate...
01:14:35<Kita> because Kita is a firm supporter of objective standards in entertainment...
01:14:43<Laevos> that's okay
01:14:46<Laevos> I guessssss
01:15:00<Kita> Because entertainment is an art form, and if people appreciated the art, then entertainment would consistently hit higher quality.
01:15:23<Laevos> of course it's an art form
01:15:28<Kita> And there would be more healthy back and forth between the artists and their fans.
01:15:49<Kita> Nowadays, a lot of people like something because not liking has consequences...
01:15:56<Laevos> O_O
01:16:00<Kita> Which is a strange concept for those who aren't like that.
01:16:09<Laevos> That's a strange concept for me!
01:16:38 Laevos: experiences multiple orgasms at our two "s a strange concept for"s lining up
01:17:09<Kita> If you don't like InsertAmericanPopArtistHere, you're a weirdo and they don't wanna talk with you about music, because you're either a pretentious hipster or a satanic metalhead.
01:17:17<Laevos> well
01:17:27<Laevos> I don't want to talk with them about music because they're not a satanic metalhead :c
01:17:50<Kita> Really... Satanism is not the worship of Satan...
01:18:05<Laevos> There are generally two things that fall under satanism
01:18:07<Laevos> LaVey types of stuff
01:18:11<Laevos> and 'orthodox Satanism'
01:18:19<Laevos> which is literally the worship of the xxxtian Satan
01:18:24<Kita> Anton LaVey, the inspirator of the most popular form of Satanism... He perscribed self-worship to be the purpose...
01:18:33<Laevos> I know who LaVey is GURL
01:18:37<Kita> And "orthodox Satanism" is not a real religion.
01:18:48<Laevos> I don't know what 'real' means
01:18:53<Laevos> there are people who profess it as their religion
01:19:02<Laevos> that's about as real as any religion can get ;P
01:19:23<Kita> It is stupid, rebellious idiots going against "the man" because they don't fucking know that atheism or agnostic atheism are real options for people with morality.
01:19:47<Laevos> Some people are just really used to ritual
01:19:55<Laevos> so the easiest thing is to flip it around
01:20:14<Kita> They choose it because it makes them feel powerful. Not an actual belief system. They become attached to the power, and embrace the ritual as a symbol of their power, and become intoxicated by the thing.
01:20:18<Kita> Drunk off the fake power.
01:20:25 Kita: harumphs.
01:20:34<Laevos> How many orthodox satanists have you talked to IRL? :P
01:20:38<Kita> Anti-philosophies irritate Kita.
01:20:47<Laevos> It is pretty silly
01:20:56<Kita> And orthodox Satanism is an anti-philosophy.
01:21:00<Laevos> yeah, it is
01:21:04<Laevos> but that doesn't make it not 'real'
01:21:06<Laevos> just... pretty silly
01:21:15<Laevos> If you mean in the sense that you don't take it seriously
01:21:16<Laevos> then sure
01:21:41<Kita> Anti-philosophies are real in the sense that they exist... But they aren't REAL philosophical standpoints.
01:21:55<Laevos> In the sense that _________________
01:21:57<Kita> They are the childish "No! I don't wanna~!" of philosophy.
01:22:19<Laevos> :3
01:22:35<Kita> The child doesn't want a bath, but doesn't know what a shower is, so he stays uncleaned.
01:22:44<Laevos> lolol
01:22:51<Laevos> that's pretty good
01:23:09<Kita> But like Kita said... They eventually become drunk off of the illusion of power that they create for themselves.
01:23:24<Kita> They rationalise the behaviour by manipulating coincidence into results.
01:23:33<Laevos> Yeah
01:23:36<Laevos> doesn't make for good human beings
01:23:42<Kita> Just like the philosophies that inspire anti-philosophies.
01:23:46<Laevos> does, however, make for good black metal personae
01:23:53<Kita> It does.
01:23:59<Laevos> because
01:24:24<Laevos> the ego is often very strongly represented
01:24:41<Laevos> the titles picked often conveying connotations of great occult power
01:24:44<Kita> Notice how Atheism does not have a real anti-philosophy. One would argue that Deism is, but it really isn't. It works with atheism to be recognised as a legitimate viewpoint.
01:24:59<Kita> Neither does Buddhism.
01:25:13<Laevos> There are definitely shitty atheists that are very 'anti-philosophy'
01:25:20<Kita> This is because these philosophical standpoints are inherently non-conflictual.
01:25:32<Kita> Nonono... Not people who are anti-philosophy...
01:25:35<Laevos> That's an... interesting conclusion xD
01:25:37<Kita> An Anti-Philosophy.
01:25:38<Laevos> I know what you mean
01:25:49<Laevos> there are people who have atheism as an Anti-philosophy
01:25:59<Laevos> as a NO YOU'RE DUMB I HATE IT kind of thing
01:26:06<Kita> But it is not, in and of itself, an anti-philosophy.
01:26:14 Laevos: shrugs ;P
01:26:43<Kita> Secular, but objective, morality is one of the many discussed topics.
01:27:12<Laevos> Yeah
01:27:21<Laevos> Hmm, what's the secular, objective age of consent? o:
01:27:45<Laevos> That's always a fun one
01:28:05<Kita> It is, only because there technically is only one in the sense of...
01:28:50<Kita> "People are not at a stage where they are developmentally mature enough until they hit __. Some hit it later, some hit it sooner. Some never get to it. Some never want it."
01:29:23<Laevos> :3
01:29:43<Kita> The answer? Probably 17, for most people, is when they become developmentally mature enough to hand sexual encounters without mental trauma.
01:30:08<Laevos> Lilith was a camwhore from age 13
01:30:57<Laevos> first orgasm was a few years before that
01:31:30<Kita> Yes... But were you ready for it?
01:31:41<Laevos> I wasn't expecting it... ._.
01:31:42<Kita> Do you feel like it has created an obsessive need for release?
01:31:59<Kita> Has it affected you mentally, in a negative way...
01:32:02<Laevos> I don't think so
01:32:04<Kita> These are the questions.
01:32:11<Laevos> perehaps it made me more sexual than I would be otherwise
01:32:14<Laevos> but I like that
01:34:23<Laevos> It made me a bit of an exhibitionist?
01:34:31<Kita> :P
01:34:33<Laevos> But maybe I already was
01:35:07<Laevos> I loved being watched, even if it was by fairly dubious 60 year old men who got off on watching little boys strip for them
01:35:15<Kita> o.O
01:35:29<Laevos> I liked the attention
01:36:11<Laevos> the thing that hurt...
01:36:21<Laevos> was not knowing that I was a sex object to them
01:36:43<Laevos> was not the men who would orgasm to the sight of me
01:36:56<Laevos> what hurt was the ones who pretended they wanted to talk to me
01:37:04<Laevos> who gave me some pretense of wanting to get closer
01:37:19<Laevos> who seemed to get off on forging an emotional connection, and then
01:37:29<Laevos> severing it as soon as they came~
01:37:36<Kita> o.x
01:37:42<Laevos> /that/ hurt.
01:39:06<Laevos> Lilith frequented gay chatrooms, teenage and otherwise, during the course of her teen years... when she was a teenage boy who wanted to be someone's sex toy.
01:39:40<Laevos> I apologize if this gives you a very negative view of your Priestess... x_x
01:39:52 Kita: shrugs.
01:39:57<Kita> People have pasts.
01:40:29<Laevos> Lilith trusts her Goddess very much...
01:40:43<Laevos> she doesn't share these things with people she doesn't trust
01:40:48 Kita: nods.
01:41:25 Laevos: does apologize though... possibly more than Goddess would have ever cared to know
01:41:40 Kita: licks.
01:41:53 Laevos: blushies... licks back <3
01:43:53<Laevos> I love you, Kita
01:43:57<Laevos> lota ;-;
01:43:59<Laevos> lots*
01:44:10<Laevos> thank you for not being like that...
01:44:29<Laevos> thank you for not getting bored with me and tossing me asside like a tissue...
01:44:55 Kita: rubrubs her ears.
01:45:04 Laevos: purrs...
01:45:15<Laevos> maybe some abandonment issues
01:47:48 Laevos: clings
01:48:07 Kita: nuzzles.
01:48:12<Kita> Shouldn't you get to bed?
01:48:14<Laevos> Yes
01:48:16<Laevos> definitely
01:48:30<Laevos> actually that's kind of relevant...
01:48:39<Laevos> maybe it's kind of an... internal fear
01:48:40<Laevos> that
01:48:45<Laevos> if I go to sleep after talking to someone
01:48:51<Laevos> they won't exist anymore when I wake up
01:48:58<Laevos> it certainly happened plenty of times
01:50:21<Laevos> but also...
01:50:25<Laevos> Lilith forgot to have dinner x_x
01:50:27<Kita> :<
01:50:28<Laevos> her tummy really hurts
01:50:35<Kita> Eat first
01:50:41<Laevos> already brushed my teeth... Dx
01:50:49<Laevos> I'll get some water at least @_@
01:51:09<Kita> Just... rebrush
01:53:35<Laevos> Got some waters <33
01:53:41<Laevos> Mmrrr...
01:53:46<Laevos> Does Kita mind that I cling so much?
01:55:48<Kita> No. Kita doesn't mind at all.
01:56:03<Laevos> Thank you ;////;
01:56:22<Laevos> Because I kind of... need you
01:56:35<Laevos> but if it becomes burdensome for Kita then I will not be as clingy ;n;
01:56:45<Kita> Need?
01:57:03 Laevos: nodnods... loves her Goddess, needs her Goddess
01:57:17<Kita> Lilith does not need Kita. She functioned fine, before. Kita is beneficial.
01:57:40 Laevos: grins
01:57:42<Kita> Kita is not needed. Kita gives Lilith purpose and fulfillment.
01:58:03<Kita> Lilith could find those elsewhere, but chooses to find them in Kita.
01:58:16<Kita> And Kita is fine with this.
01:58:16<Kita> <3
01:58:31<Laevos> Kita's a sweetheart
01:59:38<Laevos> Lilith enjoys it a whole lot, being close to someone so caring and providing...
01:59:45<Laevos> much better than what she's used to
01:59:59<Kita> <3
02:03:57<Laevos> falling asleep soon
02:04:04<Laevos> love you so so much Kita
02:04:05<Kita> Good girl
02:04:12<Laevos> thank you for everythhing
02:04:14<Laevos> love 
02:04:15<Kita> Kita loves her Priestess, too.

18:20:39<Laevos> Hihi <3
18:22:51<Kita> Hm...
18:23:13<Kita> Kita is debating on whether or not she should do the Lagann twist for when she watches with Lilith.
18:23:41<Kita> Lagann Twist: You watch the first like 16 episodes, and then watch the second movie.
18:24:08<Laevos> xD We'll see
18:24:16<Kita> There are four ways to watch the series.
18:24:24<Kita> Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann
18:24:28<Laevos> I'm sure there are many more than that!
18:24:31<Laevos> You could watch it standing on your head
18:24:37<Kita> Well.. Four common ways.
18:24:37<Kita> :P
18:24:38<Laevos> you could watch it while running a marathon
18:24:41<Laevos> Okay fine ;w;
18:25:03<Kita> The first one is Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. Watching the full, 27 episode animated series.
18:25:26<Kita> Second one is the Gurren Twist. Watch the first movie, then watch the remaining 11 episodes.
18:25:39<Kita> Third is the Lagann Twist, already explained.
18:25:48<Laevos> Hehehe
18:25:49<Laevos> twist
18:25:54<Laevos> like a drill
18:25:55<Laevos> >u>
18:25:55<Kita> And then the Double GL Feature, watching both movies.
18:26:13<Laevos> o:
18:26:27<Kita> The Gurren Twist and the Double GL Feature? Not recommended.
18:26:35<Kita> TTGL is recommended for a first time viewer.
18:26:49<Kita> Lagann Twist is recommended for a second time viewer.
18:27:33<Kita> The movies are called Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann: Gurren-Hen and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann: Lagann-Hen.
18:27:55<Laevos> OooooOO
18:29:05<Kita> That is why it is the Gurren Twist and the Lagann Twist.
18:30:20<Laevos> I see
18:32:02<Kita> FIGHTING SPIRIT
18:32:07<Kita> DETERMINATION TO SURVIVE
18:32:15<Kita> FIGHT THE OPPRESSIVE POWUH
18:32:16<Laevos> FIGHTING OF THE SPIRIT

18:32:53<Laevos> BROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
18:33:13<Kita> Kamina is awesome.
18:34:17<Laevos> :3
18:34:53<Kita> Upon further realisation...
18:35:12<Kita> Lilith probably didn't watch a subbed version. She watched a dubbed version, didn't she?
18:35:34<Laevos> Think so
18:36:00<Kita> The dubbed version, at some points...
18:36:37<Kita> Fails to convey certain emotions truthful to the original version.
18:36:40<Kita> Still isn't bad.
18:36:45<Kita> Just different.
18:37:54<Laevos> Oooh ;n;

20:38:20<Kita> Kita would like a tummy massage
20:39:47 Laevos: nods, running her fingers down her smooth, luscious stomach, gently working her slender fingertips over the surface, kneading out from the center along the sides, trickling down and washing back up like a gently twisting stream.
20:41:55 Kita: happily murrs.
20:42:15<Kita> Kita is gonna have a girl over soon to try a new feeding technique on Kita.
20:42:32<Laevos> Oh~? What technique might that be? <3

22:06:40<Kita> Dinner rolls!
22:08:49 Laevos: dinner rolls around with
22:08:58<Kita> X3
22:09:31<Kita> Dr. Spencer Reed... Boy genius of the BAU in Criminal Minds.
22:09:53<Kita> 24 with an advanced doctorate and two masters degrees.
22:10:30<Kita> If there is ever an unanswered question about facts, Dr. Reed pipes up with an answer, followed by a factoid.
22:10:40<Kita> He is a very realistic portrayal.
22:10:47<Kita> His awkwardness is very natural.
22:10:55<Laevos> :3
22:11:20<Kita> For reference on the interesting details...
22:11:44<Kita> When they are on the plane? You hear typical plane sounds.
22:12:05<Laevos> What? o.o
22:12:17<Kita> Yeah.
22:12:36<Kita> They have a plane that they ride in often, because they are FBI, not state cops.
22:12:58<Kita> And well...
22:13:22<Kita> You hear typical air sounds and plane turbulence sounds.
22:15:29<Kita> They use music, but not as much as background noise.
22:17:21<Kita> Also, they are based out of Quantico, Virginia.
22:17:36<Kita> A real FBI home base.
22:18:11<Kita> So, they try to keep it real, and make it very, very obvious that the group is made up of super hardcore specialists.
22:18:47<Laevos> Oh okay
22:18:51<Laevos> Cool :3
22:19:15<Kita> So the embellishment of their privelege is more reasonable.
22:20:22<Kita> That these guys are the top of the game, and they make it clear that while they are the best, they are not perfect.
22:20:39<Kita> They make mistakes, but they can adapt to them.
22:20:55<Laevos> the very best

22:34:03<Laevos> pretty well! :D
22:35:50<Laevos> I admitted that I'm an American, one of the mods seems to be hitting on me in a PM
22:36:11<Kita> XP
22:38:00<Laevos> xD
22:38:27<Laevos> Apparently I speak pretty decently for an American girl, I'm being told xD
22:38:32<Kita> Is it a girl?
22:38:36<Laevos> Don't know!
22:38:38<Laevos> Haven't asked... xD
22:38:49<Kita> Awwwr
22:39:30<Laevos> Male, apparently
22:39:44<Laevos> Asked him where in Germany he lived
22:40:36<Laevos> he answered and then was like
22:40:49<Laevos> "You can definitely visit sometime!"
22:40:53<Laevos> "<--------- Gentleman :3"
22:40:57<Kita> XP
22:41:04<Laevos> That made me laugh xD

23:39:17<Laevos> Lilith will always love and worship her Goddess... always. <3
23:40:08<Kita> There are nights where Kita walks the line between sane and insane.
23:40:17<Kita> Where the halves separate differently.
23:43:20 Laevos: hugs tightly
23:43:21<Laevos> love you so much
23:44:23<Kita> Nights where it isn't the two twins that pull apart...
23:44:42<Kita> Nights where her desires and her self separate.

01:02:33<Kita> There are words for people who save people, and for people who hurt people.
01:02:39<Kita> Heroes and Villains...
01:02:53<Laevos> Those are words for characters out of stories... not real life
01:03:05<Kita> But what about those of us who use our ability to save people, and twist it to hurt people?
01:03:53<Laevos> People... just people. Really, there aren't heroes, there aren't villians... there are just us, people, with flaws and vice, but also with goodness...
01:06:02<Kita> Real life is just a story that you have experienced yourself.
01:06:18<Laevos> People aren't so... cardboard cutout
01:06:34<Laevos> they don't have literary purpose besides what others might accidentally ascribe to them
01:06:42<Kita> You're right. It isn't as black and white.
01:07:04<Kita> But Kita is asking for something very specific.
01:07:15<Laevos> What's that?
01:07:56<Kita> When someone uses her ability to save people..
01:08:25<Kita> Her ability to make people better. To make them feel better. To make them safe...
01:08:33<Kita> To hurt them, instead.
01:08:40<Kita> What do we call that?
01:10:04<Laevos> Hurting people. There are lots of ways to do it, but the end result is the same... when you help people, I would imagine that they trust you, at least I do, so you have more access to them, more ways through which to inflict suffering if you so choose.
01:10:12<Laevos> Or... perhaps it isn't really a choice, sometimes :/
01:10:49<Kita> It is never a choice...
01:10:57<Kita> It is more... like a compulsion...
01:11:09<Laevos> Yeah, that's a better word @_@
01:11:15<Kita> It never feels like she is hurting them. Itn feels the same as when she helps them.
01:11:17<Laevos> If you are so compelled, t hen
01:11:57<Kita> Kita never sees when she is wrong, because she always feels right.
01:12:38<Laevos> Would Kita say that she's somewhat insulated?
01:12:58<Kita> ...Insulated?
01:13:04<Laevos> Cut off from the world
01:13:31<Kita> Not exactly.
01:14:02<Kita> Kita is limited from certain environments without escort.
01:14:08<Laevos> Does Kita have what she would call a large variety of circles of thought through which she can move? Not necessarily social circles
01:14:27<Laevos> Do places, online or offline, ever seem homogeneous?
01:14:34<Kita> No.
01:14:44<Kita> They seem contradictory.
01:15:28<Laevos> What's the most extreme difference in circles that Kita can think of presently?
01:16:55<Kita> Christianity is wrong about a myriad of topics.
01:16:55<Kita> Not allowed to criticise, because they have a right to spread what they believe.
01:18:06<Laevos> Do you often come into contact with Christians? Or hang out around them?
01:18:18<Kita> No.
01:18:40<Kita> Kita lived in a Mormon/Baptist town for most of her life.
01:18:47<Kita> But no longer lives there.
01:19:01<Laevos> (That's good, that you don't anymore :c)
01:19:11<Kita> Kita does not come into contact often, and she attempts to avoid contact with them.
01:19:21<Kita> The ideology is inherently poisonous.
01:19:24<Laevos> A wise decision
01:19:43<Laevos> and yes, it is.
01:21:34<Laevos> Hopefully Kita's brother doesn't buy into that tripe. He seems too cool to.
01:22:35 Kita: growls.
01:22:49<Kita> That isn't even a question.
01:23:03<Laevos> Indeed not <3
01:25:14<Laevos> Kita is a good person
01:25:40<Kita> No.
01:25:47<Laevos> Why do you disagree?
01:26:44 Kita: mewls
01:27:09<Laevos> You believe that you are too dangerous to be good?
01:27:35 Kita: nods.
01:28:10<Laevos> Do you believe that you are currently harming anyone?
01:28:56<Kita> Can't tell. Feels the same as not harming.
01:29:37<Laevos> To whom does Kita believe she is a danger?
01:30:52<Kita> Lilith. TrueWolves. Inkchu...
01:31:43<Laevos> In what way does Kita think she is endangering us? (Just me if you don't want to share details on your relationships with the two of them.)
01:32:31<Kita> Kita doesn't know.
01:33:18<Kita> I feels the same.
01:33:25<Kita> It*
01:33:59<Laevos> Then is it the fact that we are close to you that makes you think you must be hurting us somehow?
01:34:15<Laevos> Or are there instances where you're sure you've hurt one (or all) of us?
01:34:17<Kita> No.
01:34:51<Kita> Before Kita was medicated...
01:34:57<Kita> She could tell.
01:35:04<Kita> And she liked hurting.
01:35:23<Kita> and now... She can only see it in retrospect.
01:35:32<Kita> Like she hurts subconsciously.
01:36:15<Laevos> Do you fear that your former desire to hurt is still infecting your actions?
01:36:44<Kita> It DOES.
01:39:07<Laevos> Kita's not the same person she was then. Not even simply because of medication. On the cellular level, on the atomic level, you share next to nothing with that person. Your body has recycled itself, your mind has recycled itself, just leaving memories, and this fear, it seems, that that person still exerts influence
01:40:10<Kita> That person still exists in Kita...
01:40:13<Kita> Repressed...
01:40:24<Kita> Hidden.
01:41:37<Laevos> That sounds very fatalistic... Biologically speaking, that person's long since died. We need not always be defined by what we once were... Kita has not harmed Lilith.
01:42:09<Laevos> And while she cannot speak for TrueWolves or Inkchu, she doubts very sincerely that you've harmed them, either.
01:42:48<Kita> If Kita does not have her meds, that person WILL come back.
01:42:55<Kita> They will be uncovered.
01:43:15<Kita> A fossil, revived and ferocious.
01:46:36<Laevos> Lilith is not presuming to suggest that Kita go off of her medications. From what I can ascertain, they assure Kita's state of general well-being, and allow her to interact more positively with the world. Sometimes we need to take care of ourselves to assure that the things that can go wrong with us do not come to pass. Last night, Lilith did not take care of herself. She did not prevent herself
01:46:36<Laevos> from slipping into a vicous decline. Should Kita be afraid of Lilith?
01:47:31<Kita> Has Lilith ever killed anyone?
01:49:51<Laevos> Perhaps. Not by her own hands, but by severing ones who may otherwise have lived. Lilith has done bad things. Things for which she would not go unpunished if they came to light.
01:52:27<Kita> Kita self-inflicts her fetish...
01:53:32<Laevos> By eating?
01:54:23 Kita: nods.
01:54:26<Kita> Kita is a feeder...
01:54:41<Kita> She has no one to feed. So she feeds herself.
01:55:09<Laevos> Does Kita dislike eating as she does?
01:56:04<Kita> No.
01:56:10<Kita> Kita is an amazing cook.
01:56:57<Laevos> Lilith believes this <3
01:57:23<Laevos> So then... what's the problem? Is it because Kita yearns for someone else to feed?
01:57:59<Kita> Kita gets more satisfaction out of feeding others..
01:58:14<Kita> Feeding herself is a pacifier.
01:58:51<Laevos> Kita deserves others to feed. Is she able to do so?

18:03:58<Kita> PewDiePie is a cam whore who plays horror video games and screams and pisses his pants in a Swedish accent.
18:04:06<Laevos> lol
18:04:11<Laevos> Sounds awful
18:04:46<Laevos> AN AFFRONT TO HUMAN DECENCY
18:05:12<Kita> Much like how Tobuscus publicly embarrassed himself in a vlog, after seeing a faceless mannequin in a suit, falling over, screaming, and shouting "OH MY GOD I'M GONNA DIE, IT'S THE SLENDER MAN"
18:05:32<Laevos> IT'S THE SLENDER MAN
18:05:40<Laevos> Don't worry, just give him a $20 and you'll be fine
18:05:45<Kita> :P
18:05:58<Kita> Slenderman is an internet creepypasta phenomenon.
18:05:59<Laevos> That's the dumbest internet folklore EVER
18:06:04<Kita> XD
18:06:05<Laevos> Yeah and it's a stupid as fuck one
18:06:18<Laevos> T0TEZ SCURRY
18:06:34<Kita> It is only stupid because it got out of hand.
18:06:45<Laevos> Well, yeah
18:07:13<Laevos> Marble Hornets is pretty decent, though they at least don't call it Slenderman outright
18:08:00<Kita> Slenderman is based off of a German folklore piece called "The Night Prince"...
18:08:01<Kita> Well
18:08:10<Kita> That is the English translation, anyway.
18:08:29<Kita> And a couple of other things.
18:08:37<Kita> WHY A SUIT
18:08:44<Laevos> suits 3 scary
18:08:46<Kita> THE SUIT DOESN'T MAKE ANY DAMNED SENSE
18:09:01<Laevos> Nope
18:09:19<Laevos> Because CORPERATIONS ARE THE REAL MONSTERS, MAN
18:09:27<Laevos> maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan
18:09:29<Kita> :\
18:09:33<Laevos> I don't know
18:09:36<Kita> Valve is not a monster.
18:09:37<Kita> :<
18:10:05<Laevos> :c
18:10:16<Laevos> Then Slenderman pulls off his face and he's Valve
18:10:24<Kita> No.
18:10:29<Kita> Valve is awesome.
18:10:44<Kita> Skinnymale is lame.
18:10:56<Laevos> xD
18:10:57<Laevos> Yeah
18:11:03<Kita> Also
18:11:15<Kita> Skinnymale sounds much less threatening and very much silly.
18:12:11<Laevos> Yeah
18:12:28<Laevos> I mean Slenderman doesn't exactly strike fear into my heart
18:12:28<Laevos> rly
18:13:10 Kita: wiggles her tails like Skinnymale's tentacles and makes an unthreatening ooooooOOOOooo sound.
18:13:23<Laevos> ooooooooo
18:13:28<Laevos> o bb u kno i lov those tentacles
18:14:00<Laevos> The tentacles are a later addition, no?
18:14:22<Kita> They were.
18:14:23<Kita> :<
18:14:35<Laevos> :c
18:15:37<Kita> SCP Foundation = Much better pasta.
18:16:39<Laevos> I've read a few of those
18:16:42<Laevos> pretty neat
18:17:04<Laevos> I even played the game o:
18:17:19<Laevos> Just once, got stuck and never came back to it
18:19:55<Kita> The games aren't very good.
18:21:02<Kita> Though Kita doesn't know what she is talking about, because her version of a video game critique is how to make it better, not how to ridicule it for foerever.
18:21:09<Kita> As Kita found out, today.
18:22:04<Laevos> Oh okay
18:22:49<Kita> Kita can't possibly know anything about game design, because she is a gamer, not a professional game designer.
18:22:55 Kita: shrugs...
18:23:53<Kita> Never tell an indie developer that you don't like touch screen mechanics, and never tell an indie developer that you don't like hyper-realism in games.
18:24:02<Laevos> @_@
18:24:04<Laevos> That's silly
18:24:06<Laevos> like
18:24:16<Laevos> when people say "You can't critique something unless YOU'VE MADE ONE YOURSELF."
18:24:24<Laevos> peeps do the same thing for music
18:24:32<Laevos> Oh, you didn't like [such and such]'s album?
18:24:37<Laevos> why don't YOU GO MAKE A BETTER ONE?????
18:24:39<Laevos> Oh snap
18:24:44<Laevos> I guess that invalidates all of our arguments
18:25:04<Laevos> And hey
18:25:17<Laevos> there are far worse things that one can say to an indie developer than constructive criticism
18:25:28<Laevos> like... how they're frittering their lives away being indie game developers >:3
18:25:44<Laevos> Kidding :P
18:26:07<Laevos> a few of my friends wanted to start a game development studio
18:26:14<Laevos> and asked me to join because "I know programming"
18:26:21<Laevos> read: I took a few years of C++ classes
18:26:25<Laevos> I LAUGHED IN THEIR FACES
18:26:38<Laevos> read: Said that it didn't really seem like my kind of thing
18:27:21<Laevos> there's a community college around here with game design, and a highschool with more or less the same
18:27:39<Laevos> so about 2/3 of the people I knew from high school wanted to go on and "maek the vidya gamz"
18:27:48<Laevos> Most of them are... quite unskilled :c
18:28:08<Kita> The thing is...
18:28:26<Kita> Kita has played so many REALLY good games... and so many REALLY bad games...
18:28:33<Kita> And she listens to what people say about them.
18:28:51<Kita> And has a pretty good idea of what people like and dislike about video games.
18:28:55<Laevos> Yeah
18:29:27<Kita> What people dislike: Unintentionally horrible physics. Physics in a serious game, that behave like a joke.
18:30:10<Kita> What people like: Character development, both heroes and villains.
18:30:49<Kita> What people dislike: Listening to characters complain, or ask deep philosophical questions, unprompted.
18:30:56<Laevos> Hahahaha xD
18:31:02<Laevos> Were those things in their games?
18:31:33<Kita> The last one is actually a reference to Shadow the Hedgehog.
18:31:55<Laevos> Oh lol
18:32:34<Kita> When a character complains about some deep, philosophical question (In this case, it was "Who am I?"), without, what they believe to be, a proper, warranted prompt in the events, they get called emo, and are hated.
18:32:41<Kita> Problem with this...
18:33:03<Laevos> em0 ;-;
18:33:06<Kita> Shadow the Hedgehog was looked at as a singular game, not as a game in series. It was the direct sequel of Sonic Heroes.
18:33:16<Laevos> It was?
18:33:19<Laevos> Huh, I never played that
18:33:23<Laevos> See, I didn't even know!
18:33:25<Kita> Yeah.
18:33:56<Kita> Sonic Heroes was a non-direct sequel to Sonic Adventure 2... Where Shadow falls to Earth after his successful final gambit.
18:34:03<Laevos> Oh okay
18:34:10<Kita> And, supposedly, died.
18:34:16<Laevos> OR DID HE?
18:34:27<Kita> Well, Sonic Heroes re-introduces Shadow.
18:34:55<Laevos> Yeah :P
18:35:15<Kita> He is stumbled upon by Rouge the Bat, and he was guarded by the robo-cidal Eggman Robot, E-123, Codename "Omega".
18:35:49<Kita> Well...
18:36:12<Kita> At the end of the game, you fight Androids that are copies of Shadow.
18:36:35<Kita> And the question is asked...
18:36:53<Kita> Because Shadow was found in a capsule, in an abandoned Eggman Fleet outpost...
18:37:07<Kita> Is he the real Shadow, or a rogue, failed experimental copy.
18:37:56<Kita> So, in Shadow the Hedgehog, he goes out to answer that question.
18:38:49<Kita> (The Shadow Androids were biological machines, in the original blueprints... Brainwashed clones. This was too costly. Eventually replaced by the less-effective mechanical versions that appear in Shadow the Hedgehog.)
18:39:12<Kita> The question was prompted.
18:39:25<Kita> The execution of asking it was botched.
18:39:29<Kita> The voice acting ruined the game.
18:39:41<Kita> Proper voice acting would have made a huge difference.
18:40:12<Kita> (Actually, proper voice acting in every botched Sonic game would have made them, with the exception of 06, acceptable games.)
18:40:21<Kita> IF YOU CAN'T TELL
18:40:26<Kita> Kita likes Sonic the Hedgehog.
18:40:28<Kita> :<
18:41:12<Kita> So Kita made a good move.
18:41:18<Kita> No voice acting in her game.
18:41:19<Kita> :|
18:44:32<Laevos> Eep hi
18:44:42<Laevos> sorry, just had to call my dad
18:45:03<Laevos> and ask if he wanted to go to my German Honors Society induction
18:45:09<Laevos> (he can't, he'll be out of town)
18:45:22<Laevos> but it turned into more him telling me that he's on the kidney translpant list
18:46:43<Kita> o.o
18:46:46<Kita> Oh.
18:46:53<Kita> That doesn't sound like good news.
18:46:59<Laevos> We've known it was coming
18:47:00<Kita> Well
18:47:05<Kita> Being on the list is good news.
18:47:09<Laevos> his side of the family has a history of kidney disease
18:47:14<Kita> It is good that he qualified for a transplant.
18:47:17<Laevos> his is now below 20% function
18:47:21<Kita> :<
18:48:00<Laevos> He's made a pretty big deal of letting us know that he's on death's door (and has been saying the same thing for ~6 years)
18:48:17<Kita> That sounds counterproductive.
18:48:21<Laevos> I don't know how his outlook is, I think the technology has improved since his grandfather died from it, though
18:48:29 Kita: nods.
18:48:31<Laevos> which he doesn't seem to realize/believe
18:52:39 Laevos: licks
18:52:49 Kita: nibbles the lick.
18:53:30 Laevos: licks the nibble <3

20:18:50 Kita: noses.
20:18:55 Laevos: snuggles
20:18:58<Laevos> might have found a place to live next year
20:19:14<Kita> Steam isn't working right.
20:19:19<Laevos> ;n;  Mewmew! Dx
20:19:20<Kita> ;.;
20:19:32 Laevos: snuggles ;n;
20:19:53 Kita: nuzzles her neck.
20:20:13 Laevos: purrs and licks her cheek lovingly <3
20:21:13<Kita> Steam is being an ass. And Lilith is being brave, going out on her ownsome.
20:21:49<Laevos> ;w;
20:21:53<Laevos> Kita's cooler ;u;
20:23:05<Kita> <3
20:23:36<Laevos> Kita's THE AWESOMEST ;W;
20:25:38<Kita> Don't minimise your own successes.
20:25:42 Kita: kisses her cheek.
20:26:01<Kita> They are just as important.
20:26:01<Laevos> Bwah ;/////;
20:26:42 Laevos: kisses lovingly
20:26:45<Laevos> Thank you, Kita :3
20:27:07 Kita: rubrubs on the nerve under her ear...
20:27:16 Laevos: shivers a bit and clings to o/////o
20:27:31<Kita> X3
20:27:56<Kita> When you rub that nerve under a cat's ear, a lot of them with kick their back leg on that side.
20:28:04<Kita> Some will just tune out.
20:29:51<Laevos> xux Weak points
20:29:55<Laevos> Lilith has them in droves >_>
20:30:20<Kita> There is a group of characters in the game Okami...
20:30:34<Kita> Named Blockhead, with the last one being Blockhead Grande.
20:30:43<Laevos> OH-kami OH-kami OH-kami >u>
20:31:20<Kita> When you headbutt them, the camera switches to their facade, and dots flash upon the screen. You have to poke them with your paintbrush, in order.
20:31:37<Kita> Those are their weak points.
20:31:55<Kita> o.o
20:31:55<Kita> What?
20:32:09<Kita> Were you... mimicking the title screen?
20:32:23<Laevos> Yes
20:33:37<Kita> Ohhhhh
20:33:44<Kita> Oooooooooohhhhhhhhhh
20:33:48 Kita: wiggles excitedly.
20:33:53<Kita> You've played it!?
20:34:12<Kita> It is one of the bestest 3-D action platformers EVER.
20:34:41<Laevos> It's pretty great :3
20:34:44<Laevos> I didn't finish it, unfortunately Dx
20:34:49<Laevos> But what I did play of it, I really liked ;u;
20:35:01 Kita: <3s it.
20:35:09<Kita> ...
20:35:22<Kita> :<
20:35:22<Kita> No one ever finishes it...
20:35:22 Kita: grumbles.
20:35:30<Laevos> ;;n;;
20:35:33<Laevos> well
20:35:34<Laevos> the whole
20:35:37<Laevos> having to go back to college thing
20:35:48<Laevos> kind of cut into my available playing time
20:36:56<Kita> It deserves to be played to completion.
20:37:13<Laevos> It certainly does!
20:37:17<Laevos> I just don't have time anymore Q_Q
20:38:33<Kita> Okami is gorgeous.
20:38:41<Laevos> Yes :3
20:38:44<Laevos> Very pretty game
20:38:52<Kita> How far did you get it?
20:38:56<Kita> in it*
20:39:20<Laevos> Uhh...
20:39:22<Laevos> I don't actually remember @_@
20:39:45<Kita> Did you get past the Spider?
20:40:14<Laevos> Maybe
20:40:23<Laevos> I got past some dragon with a lot of heads, or something
20:40:28<Kita> OROCHI
20:40:32<Laevos> Yeah
20:40:37<Kita> The dreaded demon, OROCHI
20:40:44<Kita> THAT FUCKING FIGHT.
20:40:44<Laevos> Yes :3
20:40:51<Laevos> I remember it being pretty coolz
20:40:52 Kita: rolls in agony...
20:40:58 Laevos: rolls on owo
20:40:58<Kita> Yeah
20:41:05<Kita> The first time.
20:41:08<Laevos> I think where I got stuck was...
20:41:24<Laevos> some kind of
20:41:27<Laevos> motion minigame
20:41:38<Kita> Like...
20:41:41<Kita> Digging?
20:41:41<Laevos> where I had to like
20:41:42<Laevos> no
20:41:45<Laevos> it had to do with...
20:41:46<Laevos> fruit?
20:42:11 Kita: contemplates...
20:42:22<Laevos> or maybe
20:42:24<Laevos> a monkey
20:42:25<Laevos> or
20:42:25<Kita> Was there a bridge and an archer involved?
20:42:27<Laevos> getting it to rain
20:42:29<Laevos> or
20:42:32<Laevos> a dance
20:42:33<Laevos> or 
20:42:34<Laevos> SOMETHING
20:42:42<Laevos> It was a year or two ago now Q_Q
20:42:46<Kita> DID YOU MEET BUSTY BABE
20:42:59<Laevos> Uhhhhh
20:43:04<Laevos> Don't remember that xwx
20:43:09<Kita> Rao. The priestess.
20:43:14<Laevos> WAIT I THINK SO
20:43:18<Kita> Soooo much bosom.
20:43:33<Kita> You had to help her with getting back her prayer slips...
20:43:37<Laevos> Yeah
20:43:39<Kita> And then the Fox Rods?
20:44:01<Laevos> something like that mayab
20:44:21<Kita> Okay. What about the Water Dragon?
20:44:23 Kita: nibbles on.
20:44:26<Laevos> Hrmmmmmm
20:44:29<Laevos> Maybe...
20:44:33<Laevos> That sounds vaugely familiar Q_Q
20:44:51<Kita> Well...
20:45:10<Kita> What about the Emperor being sick in Rei-An City?
20:45:18<Kita> The entire city struck with a plague.
20:45:53<Laevos> Pretty sure I did that
20:46:28<Kita> Does shrinking and going inside the emperor ring a bell?
20:46:44<Laevos> Yes
20:47:02<Kita> Taking out Plague, and his sword Goldnail?
20:47:23<Kita> WHO WENT SUPAH FAST, SO YOU HAD TO SLOW TIME WITH MISTY MISTY STUFF
20:48:11<Laevos> xD
20:48:25<Kita> And fishing!
20:48:30<Kita> With Benko!
20:48:36<Kita> The Monk of 1000 swords!
20:48:38<Laevos> :33
20:48:49<Kita> Who wished only to catch the CUTLASS FISH, AKA THE LIVING SWORD.
20:48:58<Laevos> Did she?
20:49:01<Kita> (Kita fucking LOVES this game.)
20:49:05<Laevos> :D
20:49:12<Kita> And Benko was a man.
20:49:19<Laevos> Oh
20:49:21<Laevos> wait
20:49:30<Laevos> I thought that was referring to you for a second
20:49:33<Kita> Every sidequest... Really, every character, almost, was a reference to a tale in Japanese mythology.
20:49:34<Laevos> misread
20:49:56<Kita> Even the main quest.
20:50:10<Laevos> Yus :3
20:50:23<Kita> Kita learned more about her heritage playing that game, and reading and looking up tales and myths, than she ever would have from a class.
20:50:34<Laevos> That's amazing :3
20:50:53<Kita> Tobi, the Sealed Demon... Who raced you on Oni Island...
20:50:55<Kita> Sosad
20:51:05<Laevos> Q_Q
20:51:10<Kita> i cry evrytiem
20:51:21 Laevos: nestles against Kita's eyes to be cried on
20:51:25<Kita> WAKA
20:51:45<Kita> The half-baked prophet.
20:52:01<Kita> "The moon, the moon! The moon came out!" "..." "..." "Sorry, that was not one of my better ones."
20:52:07<Laevos> xD
20:52:11<Laevos> gr8 character
20:52:25<Kita> "Au revoir, ma cherie~"
20:52:36<Kita> Ammy was very expressive.
20:52:40<Kita> Very sassy.
20:52:42<Kita> Sassywoof
20:52:50<Laevos> Sasssass
20:54:02<Kita> Beautiful, shiny sassywoof.
20:54:06<Kita> So spunky.
20:54:15<Kita> Also, a genius!
20:54:24<Kita> despite what she is always told.
20:54:26<Kita> She is so smart.
20:54:28<Kita> ;.;
20:54:47<Laevos> Yes
20:54:49<Laevos> she is the best xux

01:39:40 Kita: offers her paws to be rubbed
01:39:51 Laevos: pets and rubs and massages it lovingly <3
01:41:33 Kita: noses.
01:41:57 Laevos: leans in and peers into your beautiful eyes~ "Yes, Goddess~?"
01:42:50<Kita> And cleaned... With Lilith's tongue
01:44:12 Laevos: nods excitedly, leaning down to lap devotedly across your paws, making sure to pay tribute to every single square micrometer of the divine surface~ <3
01:44:55 Kita: murrs loudly, then chirps while swishing her tails.
01:46:06 Laevos: makes her way to your wrists, finding more and more of your delectable form to worship, her tongue rubbing gently over one, then the other, pampering her Goddess with the utmost care~
01:46:49<Kita> No further than the wrists or heels
01:48:56 Laevos: nods, staying in her place, giving those spaces allowed to her her full attention
01:49:23 Kita: coos at.
01:51:25 Laevos: looks up, eyes shimmering with love <3
01:51:41 Kita: kisses her nosey.

12:20:54<Kita> ?
12:20:56<Laevos> Something!
12:21:15<Kita> What something?
12:21:24<Laevos> I need to find a "piece of visual culture" (a picture probz) that I can analyze critically through the lens of the readings we've done in WGSS
12:21:31<Laevos> basically I need to make a two-page tumblr post
12:21:42<Kita> XD
12:22:05<Kita> Do a porno. :P
12:22:18<Laevos> I could actually
12:22:31<Laevos> one of the examples we were shown in class was a vibrator ad from the '50s
12:22:49<Kita> XD
12:23:10<Laevos> its supposed 'medical qualities' were amusing
12:28:38<Laevos> Doing it on some prons might be the way to go

15:54:44<Laevos> True
15:56:52<Kita> Sexy girlbot

15:57:33<Laevos> :3
15:57:34<Laevos> Hmm
15:57:37<Laevos> hologram sounds less fun
15:58:13<Kita> But then you could be everywhere with Kita, non-intrusively.
15:58:29<Kita> And could be inserted into a robot later, for more functionality.
16:00:14 Kita: nuzzles.
16:00:30<Kita> You would be upgraded to Angel status, then.

01:02:15<Kita> Good girl
01:02:24<Kita> As for what you should say...
01:02:41<Laevos> iwas fallen and i can't get uppp
01:03:10<Kita> "Was going to make pasta, started heating water, body became suddenly weak, and I fell. Couldn't support myself. The feeling passed, but I was still a little weak."
01:03:48<Laevos> today's just been a weird day I guess
01:03:55<Laevos> couldn't get out of bed until like
01:03:58<Laevos> 17:00
01:04:03<Laevos> because I was really depressed
01:04:04<Laevos> not sad just
01:04:06<Laevos> listless
01:04:10<Laevos> felt like I couldn't do anything
01:04:12<Laevos> couldn't move really
01:04:35<Kita> Like the world was a mute, gray sheet of nothing?
01:04:52<Laevos> it was really heavy
01:05:56<Kita> :<
01:06:04<Kita> You have clinical depression.
01:06:11<Kita> No therapy could help
01:06:14<Kita> Only medication.
01:06:26<Laevos> that's kind of what I thought
01:06:39<Laevos> for the first time I was kind of like
01:06:39<Kita> You have either bad seratonin receptors, or bad seratonin production in your brain.
01:06:53<Laevos> 'okay I guess I wouldn't be self-diagnosing to say that I have some kind of depression'
01:06:54<Laevos> because
01:06:56<Laevos> I had a lot to do that day
01:07:27<Laevos> I think maybe when I orgasm a bit of seratonin happens or endorphins at least because I did that and got out of bed after but now everythings seeming kind of heavy again
01:10:20<Kita> :<
01:10:38<Laevos> yeah it's probably been affecting my performance for a while
01:11:05<Laevos> hmm
01:11:15<Laevos> Kita should robotify me so I don't need seratonin anymore
01:11:55<Laevos> until then...
01:12:04<Laevos> to whom should I communicate this problem to try and get diagnosed? x_x
01:12:33<Kita> A psychiatrist
01:14:00<Laevos> there are some at the university health center
01:14:36<Kita> Good
01:17:04<Laevos> making an appointment
01:17:14<Kita> Good girl
01:17:35<Laevos> Hope they don't robotify me too much while I'm still all fleshy
01:18:18<Laevos> Hmm...
01:18:39<Laevos> this requires information that I don't have
01:20:21<Laevos> Primary Care Physician
01:20:23<Laevos> I'd have to ask my mom
01:21:31<Laevos> oh wait
01:21:34<Laevos> that's for the hospital
01:21:41<Laevos> there's also just the student health center
01:21:45<Laevos> maybe they won't need it
01:23:40<Laevos> there we go

17:19:46<Laevos> Hihi
17:19:46<Laevos> so
17:19:49<Laevos> I went to the health clinic
17:19:57<Kita> Yeah?
17:20:02<Laevos> they said depression, anxiety, possible thyroid problem
17:20:07<Laevos> prescribed an SSRI
17:20:25<Laevos> which I'm going to go pick up in a minute
17:20:27<Kita> The SSRI dosage may need tweaking.
17:20:36<Laevos> I have another appointment
17:20:40<Laevos> they said half a capsule
17:20:40<Kita> So, make sure to keep track of your behaviour.
17:20:41<Kita> <3
17:20:44<Laevos> <3
17:20:52<Laevos> but that they'll adjust it next time
17:23:10<Laevos> I was supposed to get my blood drawn
17:23:10<Laevos> but
17:23:11<Laevos> that
17:23:12<Laevos> didn't happen
17:23:18<Kita> o.o
17:23:27<Laevos> I didn't realize that they meant right then
17:23:29<Laevos> so like
17:23:34<Laevos> they sat me down on the reclining chair
17:23:36<Laevos> told me what was going on
17:23:39<Laevos> and I broke down crying
17:23:46<Laevos> and begged to come back later
17:24:03<Laevos> and left
17:24:10<Laevos> I'm going back in a bit to pick up my medication
17:24:19<Kita> o.o
17:24:44<Laevos> Don't know if I told you, but
17:24:50<Laevos> I have a crippling phobia of needles x_x
17:26:00<Kita> You have.
17:26:05<Kita> Take a blindfold.

00:15:53<Laevos> I'm going to have to upgrade to Wheezy
00:16:28<Kita> Because Ubuntu is ultimately more user compatible, and it is the actual, practical future of Linux... Whereas Debian is slowly dying off.
00:16:53<Laevos> that's not why at all, Kita!
00:17:03<Laevos> It's because Squeeze is pretty much a depreciated version of Debian
00:17:15<Laevos> anyway, if I were to switch to another distro, it wouldn't be Upoontu
00:17:23<Laevos> probably arch
00:17:29<Kita> It really should be Ubuntu.
00:17:33<Laevos> I've used it
00:17:34<Laevos> didn't like it
00:17:43<Kita> Whyfor?
00:18:01<Laevos> well, I guess it wasn't terrible, Debian was just always better for my purposes
00:18:06<Laevos> server-type stuff
00:18:16<Laevos> I don't use GNOME or any other GUI environment, so
00:18:31<Kita> KDE is a better GUI option for Ubuntu.
00:18:38<Laevos> I don't use any GUI
00:18:38<Kita> And Ubuntu is more for general computering.
00:18:43<Laevos> Yeah, I wouldn't be doing that
00:19:18<Laevos> arch is great as a development environment, I've heard
00:19:23<Laevos> but I'd have to get used to it
00:19:57 Kita: is kind of attached kUbuntu

00:21:57<Laevos> Yay :3
00:22:04<Kita> Runs even better on the desktop.

01:39:09 Kita: kisses.
01:40:18 Laevos: kisses
01:41:11<Kita> Seeking this kind of effective, safe, chemical assistance is a sign of growth, especially considering your anti-substances position...
01:41:19<Kita> Who taught you that?
01:41:32<Laevos> I did
01:41:47<Kita> What influenced it?
01:41:59<Laevos> It seemed like the right thing to do
01:43:24<Kita> You'd rather be happy than "pure" though, right?
01:43:51<Laevos> maybe not...
01:44:09<Kita> ?
01:44:19<Laevos> I'm not sure that I would...
01:45:06<Kita> What is purity
01:45:30<Laevos> whatever I decide that it is for myself at any given moment...
01:45:42<Laevos> don't drink soda
01:45:47<Laevos> don't eat things with butter
01:46:00<Laevos> don't smoke
01:46:04<Laevos> don't medicate your brain
01:46:30<Kita> Medicating your brain can make your life better
01:47:20<Laevos> I want to break down crying
01:47:22<Laevos> but I can't
01:47:23<Laevos> too flat
01:47:28<Laevos> and I don't like that
01:47:56<Kita> The amount needs adjusting.
01:48:02<Kita> Maybe you should call them.
01:48:14<Laevos> I wanna stop...
01:48:48<Kita> Please, Lilith.
01:48:52<Kita> Stick with it.
01:48:54<Kita> :<
01:49:08<Laevos> maybe there's something else
01:49:13<Laevos> maybe I Could do therapy or meditation
01:49:29<Kita> Meditation is a placebo... It wouldn't work forever.
01:49:44<Kita> And therapy should be pursued ON TOP of the medication.
01:50:00<Laevos> I'm not taking this forever...
01:50:12<Kita> They'll change it.
01:50:20<Kita> You won't feel like this forever.
01:50:38<Kita> This is not the desired result.
01:50:50<Laevos> it's going to make me flat
01:50:56<Kita> Not forever.
01:51:09<Kita> If they tell you to stop, then you'll bounce back.
01:51:50<Kita> If you tell them how you are feeling, they will adjust it so you don't feel like that anymore.
01:51:59<Kita> They won't let you stay like this.
01:52:01<Kita> Okay?
01:52:04<Kita> It takes time.
01:52:15<Kita> So... give it time.
01:52:19<Laevos> I don't want to do this anymore... I changed my mind
01:52:30<Kita> ...
01:52:52<Laevos> I can't...
01:52:52<Kita> Not even a week?
01:52:57<Kita> It is just a week.
01:53:02<Laevos> it's an important week...
01:53:06<Kita> And the dosage changes in a couple of days.
01:53:09<Laevos> I need to do a whole research project
01:53:16<Laevos> finals
01:53:16<Laevos> tests
01:53:19<Laevos> homework
01:53:21<Laevos> I'm slipping
01:53:34<Kita> You were slipping before the meds.
01:53:49<Laevos> I won't get anything done like this...
01:53:53<Kita> Lilith.
01:54:12<Kita> Would Kita ever ask Lilith to do something that would harm her?
01:54:42<Laevos> not directly but Kita might not have enough of a grasp on the situation to know what will harm me...
01:54:55 Kita: points to herself.
01:55:05<Laevos> we have different brains...
01:55:19<Kita> But humans follow patterns.
01:55:48<Laevos> if this stupid shit was doing its job I wouldn't feel like this right now
01:55:50<Laevos> it's useless...
01:56:03<Kita> You have the wrong dose.
01:56:18<Kita> It may be the wrong med.
01:56:29<Kita> So you tell them.
01:56:34<Kita> And they will change it.
01:56:55<Kita> So many different things cause the same results.
01:56:55<Laevos> I feel so dirty
01:57:17 Kita: sits on Lilith's lap.
01:57:37<Kita> You're not dirty... You're just scared.
01:57:41<Kita> This is new to you.
01:57:46<Laevos> so scared...
01:58:07<Kita> Hold Kita's hands...
01:58:27<Kita> Kita went through this, too...The cloudiness, the numb feeling...
01:58:39<Kita> The flat feeling.
01:58:40<Laevos> i need to sleep
01:58:47 Kita: kisses her nose.
01:59:00<Kita> Please take your meds, when you're supposed to.
01:59:07<Kita> Please.
01:59:16<Kita> Please please please.
01:59:35<Laevos> my tears are fighting a fogyg wall in front of my eyes and at the back of my head
01:59:53<Kita> Kita promises that if Lilith does what the doctor tells her, it will eventually be better.
02:00:09<Kita> As long as Lilith TALKS to the doctor.
02:00:21<Kita> As in... Maybe Lilith should call in the morning.
02:00:51<Laevos> i feel like i'm about t doie
02:00:54<Laevos> to die
02:01:08<Laevos> ican't breathe
02:01:10<Kita> You're not dying...
02:01:16<Kita> You can still breathe.
02:01:18<Kita> Calm down.
02:01:32<Kita> You're beginning to have a panick attack.
02:01:42<Laevos> yes
02:02:25<Kita> Okay! This is good! It isn't good that you're having a panick attack, but the meds not stopping the panick attack means that they are not strong enough.
02:02:40<Kita> (Probably.)
02:03:26<Kita> Your brain is out of balance, because it isn't used to an inhibitor.
02:03:49<Kita> So it responds by flooding the system.
02:04:22<Kita> (Unless the panick attack means that it isn't targeting the right thing, which just means they need to use a different med.)
02:04:50<Kita> But it is a little early to tell.
02:04:56<Laevos> im going to go cry myself to sleep now...
02:05:03<Kita> Lilith...
02:05:07<Laevos> 2am

17:56:58<Kita> Some temporary discomfort sparked a pre-existing condition that typically goes unnoticed because you are rarely in new forms of discomfort.
17:57:43<Kita> It was aggravated by the medication... Which was probably at an experimental dosage... Which is how they find effective dosages
17:58:06<Kita> You don't know how to treat arm pain unless you know why the pain is there.
17:58:15<Laevos> everything is... temporary
17:58:22<Kita> Is the arm broken? Is it bleeding internally? Did they pull a muscle?
17:58:35<Kita> Once you know that, you can treat it.
17:59:09<Kita> It is unfortunate that you let the paranoia get to you like that.
17:59:33<Kita> But ultimately, you're the one who has to deal with being miserable.
18:00:06<Laevos> "Oh, let me in, to the city... / Oh, let me out, in the crowd. / If you see me, lying on the ground, / walk around."
18:01:37<Kita> Kita is going to do some stuff...
18:01:44<Kita> Unless you REALLY need her
18:02:01<Kita> Let her be until the meds are flushed out of the system...
18:02:16<Kita> And your violent paranoia has subsided.

13:15:51<Laevos> hihi
13:19:31<Kita> You've been quiet
13:19:44<Laevos> Yeah... trying to keep up with school things...
13:19:55<Laevos> now it's t he weekend, seems like it'll be a pretty typical one @_@
13:24:24 Kita: offers a bowl of long-grained, brown rice.
13:24:38 Laevos: nomps it up ;-;
13:24:50<Kita> Rice is wonderful.
13:26:11<Laevos> It's the best
13:26:12<Laevos> ever

13:27:27<Kita> http://www.bodyenergyclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/20130520-150449.jpg
13:27:32<Kita> Rice does, too.
13:28:05<Laevos> I only eat carbs pretty much
13:28:15<Laevos> they're my body's only source of energy to avoid imploding
13:28:18<Laevos> so... haven't gotten fat off of it yet
13:28:28<Kita> o.o
13:28:42<Kita> People with normal metabolisms get fat off bread.
13:28:43<Kita> :P
13:28:52<Laevos> That's their problem, not mine!
13:29:08<Kita> Also, eating sugar + carbs...
13:29:22<Kita> Sugar is priority, so the energy from the carbs gets stored.
13:29:33<Laevos> I don't eat that much sugary stuff
13:29:46<Laevos> that's the thang
13:30:51<Kita> Rice, though.. Is mostly just carbs.
13:36:06<Kita> Do you have a rice cooker
13:37:34<Kita> Goddess of the grains~

14:11:39<Kita> Criminal Minds VS CSI:NY
14:11:44<Kita> Scenario
14:12:31<Kita> Four bodies, one survivor, all suffocated with bags, duct-tape-bondage, one bullet to the head, four to the body.
14:13:01<Kita> All valuables taken. Safe emptied.
14:13:27<Kita> Criminal Minds: Sadistic sociopath serial killer, using the robbery to cover his tracks.
14:13:38<Kita> CSI:NY: It was a hitman.
14:17:27<Laevos> pflflflf xD
14:18:02<Kita> Criminal Minds is a much better show, just from the standpoint of how they write the criminal psyches.
14:18:32<Kita> Unsubs with strange MOs are almost ALWAYS serial offenders.
14:18:49<Kita> (Whether it be killing, rape, or robbery... Serial offenders have tells.)
14:18:53<Laevos> Yeah
14:20:54 Kita: rolls on
14:22:10<Kita> Also
14:22:44 Kita: can't watch anything with Frankie Muniz in it, without immediately correalating it as the future of Malcolm, from Malcolm in the Middle.
14:25:21<Laevos> Hahahaha xD
14:25:25<Laevos> Fair enough I suppose
14:25:26 Laevos: cuddles
14:25:43<Kita> So it's like...
14:26:22<Kita> Stay Alive was another movie he was in... Where he plays a high schooler who is a game genius.
14:26:41<Kita> (Stay Alive is good, for B-Rated horror.)
14:26:50<Kita> (Really good for a Sci-fi original.)
14:27:01<Laevos> :3
14:27:10<Kita> (I guess they are Syfy now, though.)
14:27:18<Laevos> Yeah
14:27:20<Laevos> seefee
14:27:41<Kita> X3
14:28:03<Kita> And they got rid of Animonday, so we'll never see the second half of Rave Master.
14:28:04<Kita> ;.;
14:28:11<Laevos> Never ever ;n;
14:29:35<Kita> Rave Master was so good.

14:33:31<Kita> Oh
14:33:49<Laevos> My room/apartment is too cramped to do a single thing in @_@
14:33:54<Laevos> and it's a mess ;n;
14:33:57<Kita> awwwwr
14:34:05<Kita> Messy kitty?
14:34:13<Laevos> Just still have boxes around from when I moved in

14:34:21<Kita> Oh
14:34:32 Kita: nods.
14:34:35<Laevos> and nowhere to unpack the things in boxes to
14:34:35<Laevos> so
14:34:40<Laevos> not much I can do about it while I'm still living here
14:35:15<Kita> You could build furniture out of the boxes.
14:36:09<Laevos> Nah, they don't have the structural integrity xwx
14:36:12<Laevos> they're mostly filled with air

18:17:52<Kita> Been looking into this new game...
18:17:55<Kita> Melody's Escape

18:18:14<Kita> And if it really is that?
18:18:14<Laevos> Sounds COOL

18:22:17<Laevos> That SOUNDS good ouo
18:26:35<Kita> Bit.TRIP Runner style gameplay
18:26:49<Kita> Audiosurf's procedural track generation.

18:36:05<Laevos> what's the control mechanism used to hit the shaded portions of circles?
18:36:06<Laevos> Mouse?
18:36:26<Kita> Coloured buttons, on a controller.
18:36:28<Kita> Or
18:36:32<Kita> Arrow keys.
18:36:41<Kita> With WASD controlling the arrows.
18:36:44<Laevos> Okay
18:37:00<Laevos> I can DEAL with that
18:37:01<Kita> DUAL-FISTING THIS BITCH

22:15:43<Laevos> Yeah, but you know what's soooooooooo goooooooood?
22:15:44<Laevos> Kita :3
22:15:58<Kita> And Kita played Cave Story
22:15:59<Kita> thus
22:16:03<Kita> good by association.
22:16:05<Laevos> :3
22:16:06<Laevos> That's true
22:16:24<Kita> Kita is actually really, really good at platformers.
22:16:51<Laevos> :33333
22:16:53<Kita> La-Mulana, Mega Man, Metroid, Cave Story...
22:16:59<Laevos> Lilith likes platformers
22:17:00<Kita> And then the 3-D platformers...
22:17:05<Kita> Original Spyro trilogy.
22:17:21<Kita> The Legend of Spyro trilogy...
22:17:36<Kita> (Every other Spyro game sucks...)
22:17:46<Laevos> :D
22:17:50<Laevos> That's very true.
22:17:51<Kita> Sonic Adventure 1 and 2, the GameCube version of Sonic Heroes...
22:18:07<Kita> (All are better on Dreamcast, but...)
22:18:35<Kita> Portal and Portal 2
22:18:40<Kita> (FPPP)
22:18:52<Kita> (Er... First Person Puzzle Platformer)
22:19:25<Laevos> Portal seemed okay
22:19:39<Kita> Portal is better if you finish.
22:19:42<Laevos> :3
22:19:57<Kita> The difference between liking Portal and loving Portal, literally, is finishing the game.
22:20:59<Laevos> o:
22:21:03<Laevos> Hopefully not because of THE DANG SONG
22:21:04<Laevos> >:c
22:21:09<Kita> No.
22:21:19<Kita> But the song becomes symbolic.
22:21:19<Kita> <3

22:22:09<Kita> Hold this.
22:22:53 Laevos: holds it
22:22:55<Laevos> can I smooch it? ;n;
22:23:00<Kita> Of course.
22:23:44 Laevos: eeeeeeeeeee~!s and smooches lovingly ^/////////^
22:23:48 Kita: shoves her hand down her neckhole and pulls out a fork, before taking her head back and re-attaching it.
22:23:49<Kita> <3
22:24:43<Laevos> o: Glad I could help!
22:26:59 Kita: offers the fork to Lilith.
22:27:25 Laevos: holds it o_o
22:27:39<Kita> Keep it
22:27:53 Laevos: keeps it forever, treasuring it
22:27:56<Kita> X3
22:28:00<Kita> Is just a fork
22:29:32<Laevos> TREASURING IT

00:32:54<Laevos> Yeah, I haven't seen it
00:32:56<Kita> And it is good.
00:32:59<Laevos> Okay :3

00:33:22<Laevos> Good!

12:11:10<Laevos> @____@
12:11:13<Kita> How...

12:11:25<Laevos> A lot
12:11:30<Laevos> 11/10 mental defunctitude
12:11:35<Kita> Every registered candidate should be on every ballot.
12:11:45<Laevos> Fo shizzle :c
12:12:19<Kita> There is a spot for write-ins...
12:12:22<Kita> But still.
12:12:31<Laevos> Yeah, still :/
12:12:48<Kita> Write-ins are for non-registered candidates.
12:13:08<Kita> Or, a way to say "All these choices suck"
12:13:24<Kita> or "I'm not voting for the only person running for this spot."
12:13:57<Laevos> Yeah x__x
12:14:02<Kita> It is 10:11 AM and Kita has already become unable to can.

12:15:02<Kita> Not what Kita meant.
12:15:37 Laevos: gives Kita some science book from when she was a child called "You Can With Beakman!" ;;-;;

12:42:50<Kita> 4Chan, you brilliant bastards.
12:44:00<Kita> They really did get "free bleeding" trending, by pretending to be feminists "rejecting the opression of male-encouraged menstruation products" because they "force them to reject the natural occurences of their body's pure cycles."
12:44:44<Kita> Free bleeding... is basically menstruating... without a tampon or Diva Cup or anything...
12:44:48<Laevos> Dumbass white kids co-opting feminism to take advantage of poorly informed folks. Truly ~brilliant~ e_e
12:44:52<Laevos> Yeah I know
12:44:54<Kita> And it is basically fucking disgusting.
12:45:13<Kita> Well, Kita didn't say it was ethical.
12:45:24<Kita> She just said that they were actually smart enough to pull it off.
12:45:46<Kita> (And convincing the people who take feminism to Female Superiority to do something fucking stupid.)
12:46:45<Kita> Kita is most certainly a feminist, just on the virtue of being someone who pursues civil rights.
12:46:55<Laevos> jawohl
12:47:12<Kita> Every is equal, until they prove themselves to be lesser by being a fucking moron.
12:47:15<Kita> :3
12:47:41<Laevos> lol

12:52:36<Kita> 1 cuul is 1 level of abstraction away from reality.

14:58:29<Kita> [12:54] * ~Kita discussing how QTE in video games are tools, and they can be used effectively, and actually add to the game's experience... many, many people disagree.
14:58:29<Kita> [12:54] <~Kita> However, they do so by ignoring the games that have them and use them well.
14:58:29<Kita> [12:56] <~Kita> Kingdom Hearts II has Reaction Commands with many of the bosses. These escalate into QTE cutscenes when activated, but they are handled gracefully. They don't do overpowered amounts of damage on completion, either. They increase flow in battle.

23:29:52<Laevos> O_O
23:29:54<Laevos> Are you okay?
23:30:40<Kita> Imagine if everyone you knew became obsessed with something.
23:31:01<Kita> And, you think it is an odd thing to become obsessed with.
23:31:14<Kita> As time goes on, their obsession and love only deepens...
23:31:32<Laevos> :333
23:31:35<Kita> You, to keep up with them, struggle, very hard, to understand what it is they love about it so much...
23:31:37<Laevos> is it ponyo?
23:31:52<Kita> But you can't.
23:31:57<Kita> And trying frustrates you.
23:32:04<Kita> It just... doesn't click.
23:32:07<Laevos> KITA OUT WITH IT
23:32:12<Laevos> Is it the ponyos?
23:32:20<Kita> Everything about the obsession states that it should click with you...
23:32:43<Kita> But IT DOESN'T FUCKING MAKE ANY GOD DAMN SENSE WHY EVERYONE FUCKING LOVES IT SO FUCKING MUCH
23:32:51<Kita> And that feeling boils inside of you.
23:33:02<Kita> Every time it is mentioned, the frustration returns.
23:33:13<Kita> There has never been anything you COULDN'T understand.
23:33:19<Kita> But this... This eludes you.
23:33:35<Kita> And you begin to lose the ability to relate to your friends.
23:33:38<Laevos> (I used to wonder what friendship could be)
23:33:41<Kita> It is all they want to talk about.
23:33:55<Kita> It is all they want to do
23:34:01<Laevos> (Until you all shared its... magic... with me?)
23:34:25<Kita> And they stop wanting to talk to you, because you can't share their obsession with them...
23:34:33<Kita> And you begin to be left alone...
23:34:44<Laevos> Well that's neither big adventure nor tons of fun
23:34:45<Laevos> damn it
23:35:00<Laevos> or w/e it is
23:35:05<Kita> Incapable of understanding why they would be so obsessed about that they would leave you because you can't like it...
23:35:18<Kita> And every time it is even hinted at...
23:35:32<Kita> All the pain and frustration hits you like a train
23:35:35<Kita> So hard that you become sick
23:35:51<Kita> That is what MLP:FiM is to Kita...
23:36:13<Kita> Nothing but pain, frustration, distance, and loneliness.
23:36:28<Laevos> 'Cause you know you are my... okay now that's just getting dark :c
23:36:52 Kita: curls up
23:36:59 Laevos: clings on ;-;
23:37:50<Kita> Mediocre, kids show about stupidly coloured horses and lovey dovey conquers all themology.
23:39:44<Laevos> The German dub is surprisingly competent, helped me learn a few new words with them catchy tunez
23:40:22<Kita> Doesn't change the fact that it is still just a poorly themed kids show with decent writers...
23:40:34<Laevos> I dunno what you want me to say, yo
23:40:47<Kita> Kita doesn't expect anything.
23:40:52<Laevos> I'm sorry you had dipshit friends who couldn't relate to somebody anymore on the basis of one media item
23:41:02<Kita> It consumed their lives.
23:41:11<Kita> And Kita tried so hard to understand the appeal.
23:41:16<Kita> But she DOESN'T
23:41:19<Kita> And she CAN'T.
23:41:24<Laevos> well there was your first mistake
23:41:33<Laevos> people like all kinds of things
23:41:36<Kita> And Kita has never, ever been incapable of this.
23:41:38<Laevos> no accounting for taste, yo
23:41:59<Laevos> It's cute, there are little horses that go around and do silly things
23:42:04<Laevos> that's pretty much it for me rly
23:42:18<Kita> Kita doesn't see that.
23:42:25<Laevos> that's okay
23:42:36<Kita> Every time Kita watches a program, or plays a game...
23:42:55<Kita> It's like every individual piece gets pulled out into diagrams...
23:43:11<Kita> Pulled apart like schematic drawings.
23:43:23<Kita> The holographic 3-D models in movies?
23:43:48<Laevos> what
23:43:57<Kita> Yeah
23:44:12<Kita> It happens in the back of Kita's mind
23:44:20<Kita> holographic? hologram*
23:44:26<Laevos> Oh
23:44:28<Laevos> okay
23:44:31<Laevos> it's kinda funny
23:44:46<Kita> It is the only way Kita can experience media.
23:44:46<Laevos> the first person I knew to go off on me about all that there ponyo stuff was like
23:44:58<Laevos> I RESPECT YOU LESS FOR ENJOYING THIS YOU'RE A BAD PERSON
23:45:02<Laevos> to which I was like
23:45:04<Laevos> 'ok'
23:45:12<Laevos> then she watched the show and now she's a fan of it
23:45:14<Laevos> I didn't rub it in
23:45:18<Laevos> because I'M SO NICE
23:45:36<Kita> Ponyo is a Miyazaki film.
23:45:49<Laevos> Yeah
23:45:59<Laevos> and teh ponyos is  how I refer to My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic
23:46:00<Kita> Actually, the full title is Ponyo On the Cliff...
23:46:08<Kita> But in America it was just Ponyo.
23:46:12<Laevos> get it
23:46:13<Laevos> because
23:46:15<Laevos> ponyo is like
23:46:17<Laevos> pony...o
23:46:22<Laevos> Like Big O
23:46:24<Laevos> but not
23:46:31<Kita> Big
23:46:36<Kita> Except it is ENORMOUS
23:46:46<Kita> It is one of the most popular cartoons of all time
23:46:51<Kita> FOR NO FUCKING REASON
23:46:51<Laevos> Big O?
23:46:55<Kita> No.
23:46:57<Kita> MLP
23:47:13<Laevos> lots of people like them little horses
23:47:14<Laevos> you know
23:47:25<Kita> Yeah, and they have a lot of reasons
23:47:26<Laevos> dancing around
23:47:30<Kita> But none of them are collective?
23:47:37<Laevos> what's an collective reason?
23:48:18<Kita> Some people think the writing is meh but the art is INCREDIBLE, others think the opposite...
23:48:35<Laevos> are you trying to instill some kind of like
23:48:38<Kita> There are sects of the MLP fandom and they interargue, all the time, over why it became popular
23:48:39<Laevos> objective taste in media?
23:48:44<Kita> No.
23:48:54<Laevos> why do you want a fanbase to have consistency then?
23:48:57<Laevos> Or even expect it to?
23:49:02<Kita> Because most do
23:49:04<Laevos> It's just a lot of people who like a media object
23:49:18<Laevos> NEway
23:49:26<Laevos> the ponyos have a lot of those fans who are like
23:49:30<Laevos> fans of being a fans of things
23:49:33<Kita> A supermajority that acclaims certain qualities, and stragglers that reject the supermajority's norm.
23:49:35<Laevos> same as Dr. Who,  teh Homestucks
23:49:51<Laevos> other random things in
23:49:55<Laevos> ~geek culture~
23:50:00<Laevos> i.e. shitty humans
23:50:06<Laevos> death to geeks
23:54:14<Kita> [21:49] <Kita> It wasn't that they left.
23:54:14<Kita> [21:50] <Kita> There was natural drift, that before would have never happened.
23:54:14<Kita> [21:50] <Kita> The show created a divide.
23:54:14<Kita> [21:50] <Kita> It consumed them.
23:54:14<Kita> [21:50] <Kita> Their life became that fucking fandom.
23:54:15<Kita> [21:50] <Kita> And their personalities mutated.
23:54:15<Kita> [21:50] <Kita> Until there was a day that Kita realised...
23:54:15<Kita> [21:51] <Kita> Kita could no longer relate to them, and they no longer related to Kita. They continued to talk merely out of habit. All the feelings were gone. It was rehearsed, robotic.
23:54:41<Laevos> sry they were such poop faces
23:54:44<Laevos> you should find
23:54:46<Laevos> BETTER FRIENDS
23:55:01<Kita> And Kita was separated from her greatest support group... by an inability to understand a psychological facet.
23:55:10<Laevos> it sucks
23:55:15<Laevos> losing your support group
23:55:21<Laevos> your foundation
23:55:23<Laevos> everything
23:55:23<Kita> The only thing she thought she had was a grasp on the function of the human psyche.
23:55:34<Laevos> being left with nothing
23:55:42<Laevos> that's a rather weighty claim!
23:55:45<Kita> The foundation of Kita's intellect was in understanding how people function on a level most basic and malleable.
23:56:02<Laevos> Lilith has 100% insight into her own mind and everything regarding it
23:56:10<Laevos> that doesn't mean control, of course
23:56:14<Laevos> but complete knowledge thereof
23:56:15<Laevos> at all times
23:56:16<Laevos> always :3
23:56:17<Laevos> but
23:56:30<Laevos> her knowledge doesn't in that area doesn't extend beyond herself to any other beings
23:57:01<Kita> Kita has substantial knowledge on ALL minds... Her fascination in how minds break has led her to understanding the broken bits of all minds...
23:57:13<Kita> And everyone has a broken mind, in some form or another.
23:57:47<Laevos> But then CARTOON HORSES and everything you knew was wrong yeah
23:57:50<Laevos> well
23:57:51<Laevos> it happens
23:59:03<Kita> Not everything was wrong
23:59:08<Kita> There is a fucking hole
23:59:13<Kita> And nothing can ever fill it
23:59:29<Kita> And there are so many people with which Kita can no longer reliably predict.
23:59:43<Kita> Kita cannot control all her interactions anymore.
23:59:49<Kita> There is a missing variable.
23:59:53<Laevos> sux2balive
23:59:59<Laevos> it does though
--- Day changed Wed May 07 2014
00:00:01<Laevos> not kidding
00:00:09<Laevos> that's why I want to kill myself a lot of the time
00:01:34<Kita> Kita needs control.
00:01:38<Kita> Lilith is easy to talk to.
00:01:42<Kita> Easy to understand.
00:01:53<Laevos> :3
00:01:59<Kita> Conversation is easy to maintain and manuever.
00:02:01<Laevos> and Lilith likes being controlled
00:02:14<Kita> But Kita doesn't control Lilith.
00:02:18<Laevos> no
00:02:20<Kita> Kita predicts Lilith.
00:02:34<Laevos> two way street baby
00:02:39<Laevos> we complement each other at our best 8D
00:03:15<Kita> But Kita does this with EVERYONE.
00:03:19<Kita> People are predictable
00:03:22<Kita> Until THAT
00:03:31<Kita> A cog went missing in the clock.
00:03:34<Laevos> :c
00:04:24<Kita> They don't really ever do it back...
00:04:33<Kita> But that is why it feels like order and control.
00:04:49<Laevos> Sometimes people just pull the rug out from under you
00:05:01<Laevos> spend enough time around anyone and you'll show them exactly how to tear you apart
00:05:08<Laevos> not that that necessarily happened to you in this case
00:05:08<Laevos> but
00:05:12<Laevos> like you said
00:05:14<Laevos> something went wrong
00:05:21<Laevos> they wrenched themselves from you irrevocably
00:05:45<Kita> If that show was never made, it would have never happened.
00:06:02<Kita> It is a fluke in otherwise perfect knowledge of the species psyche.
00:08:31 Kita: fidgits and shivers.
00:09:00 Laevos: hugs on ;-;
00:09:05<Laevos> I'm sorry Kita
00:09:22<Laevos> I know what it's like to lose people... maybe not to lose a sense of perfect understanding of a species, but...
00:09:23 Laevos: hugs
00:10:24 Laevos: kisses
00:10:29 Laevos: pays tribute to ;;-;;
00:10:37 Kita: leans on.
00:10:46 Laevos: looks into your eyes
00:10:49<Laevos> Goddess.
00:10:59 Laevos: licks at your cheek... <3
00:11:33 Kita: clings.
00:12:03<Laevos> Intelligent, beautiful, wise, lovely, generous, kind Goddess. <3
00:12:40<Kita> Mentally unstable
00:12:58<Laevos> Yes, but so's everyone, as you said <3
00:13:05<Laevos> to varying degrees, sure, but still
00:13:10<Laevos> You're ~the best~, Goddess
00:16:57 Laevos: loves you.
00:17:11 Kita: curls against.
00:17:30 Laevos: clings on
00:18:00<Kita> Kita's personal fictional avatar, which is like an RP self-insert...
00:18:58<Kita> Is an Avatar of Order, sub category balance, working to preserve the Order/Chaos balance.
00:19:17<Laevos> Mrr <3
00:21:10<Kita> Claiming that this instance of reality is BASED on that balance.
00:23:22<Kita> Her specialisation was destruction of individuals looking to hi-jack the balance for power, or tilt the scales towards their own alignment
00:24:13<Laevos> You can do it ;-;
00:24:59<Kita> This character was supremely powerful...
00:25:22<Kita> But was defeated by her own arrogance and hastiness.
00:25:37<Laevos> Q~Q
00:26:21<Kita> She is the manifestation of a voice from Kita's head.

00:58:27 Kita: slowly melts in her lap
01:00:08 Laevos: melts overe with ;/////; needy and clingy
01:00:21 Kita: re-congeals
01:04:15 Laevos: fuses with ;;-;;
01:04:32 Kita: panicks.
01:04:37<Kita> Noononono
01:04:44 Kita: separates from.
01:04:48<Kita> No
01:05:06 Laevos: unfuses, never to do so again
01:05:12<Laevos> sorry, Goddess
01:05:18<Laevos> never ever again <3...
01:05:36<Kita> Kita may not look like it, but she is a single unit
01:06:00<Laevos> and shall ever so remain, yes? <3
01:06:09<Kita> Please.
01:06:18<Laevos> Lilith loves you a whole lot
01:06:19<Laevos> as you
01:06:21<Laevos> won't fuse with you
01:06:24<Laevos> will just worship you
01:06:33<Kita> Good kitty.
01:06:40<Laevos> <3
01:06:42<Laevos> Kitty loves you
01:07:14 Kita: rubs her chin
01:07:19 Laevos: kisses
01:09:00 Kita: feeds her a cookie, then offers catnip
01:09:28 Laevos: nomps, rolls around in it
01:09:53<Kita> X3
01:10:07<Kita> Cats eat catnip
01:10:17<Kita> Is why they get high, off of it
01:10:52 Laevos: just rolls ;u;
01:11:01<Laevos> Kita  can come get high and Lilith will lick her o:
01:11:03<Kita> X3
01:11:35<Kita> Lilith would probably enjoy it, if she could stay calm.
01:11:52<Kita> First time actually being stoned, Kita panicked.
01:12:07<Kita> It wasn't awful
01:12:15<Kita> But the next time was much, much nicer.
01:12:20<Kita> Kita didn't panick.
01:12:31<Laevos> you can get me high on smoochies :3
01:12:45<Kita> It doesn't feel floaty...
01:12:53<Kita> It feels like gravity is increasing
01:13:14<Kita> But not so much that you can't move, just enough so that you don't feel like moving.
01:13:30<Kita> Skin has a weird feeling, but it feels good.
01:14:06<Kita> Like you have a showerhead over it... Pounding water on you, but you are dry, and the feeling is steady and constant, unlike a shower head.
01:14:07<Laevos> ;n;
01:14:21<Kita> Is very relaxing.
01:14:25<Kita> Feels very nice.
01:14:38<Kita> You just want to sit there and enjoy it.
01:14:53<Kita> And getting touched is AWESOME.
01:15:04<Kita> So like
01:15:04<Laevos> it already is ;-;
01:15:16<Kita> It feels even better when stoned.
01:15:27<Kita> Crossdress, shave, and get high with Kita
01:15:28<Kita> <3
01:15:56<Kita> Kita is stoned about 3 or 4 days out of the week.
01:16:17 Kita: got stoned just now, to help ease the bad feelings, earlier.
01:16:30<Laevos> I shaved...
01:16:34<Laevos> I wanna crossdress...
01:17:02 Kita: offers her paw
01:17:11 Laevos: smooches it
01:17:43 Kita: is pretty sure Lilith would enjoy being high. Lilith would not enjoy being drunk.
01:17:51<Kita> You don't hallucinate.
01:18:01<Kita> No seeing or hearing shit.
01:18:05<Kita> It is a trip.
01:18:19<Kita> (No... That is LSD. A very, very rare treat for Kita.)
01:18:31<Laevos> will Kita dress me up?
01:18:33<Kita> It isn't*
01:18:36<Kita> Oh yush
01:18:51<Kita> Lilith will have a pretty, modest dress...
01:18:56<Laevos> Will I be pretty? <3
01:19:10<Kita> some hip pads and cup inserts, too
01:19:39<Laevos> Mmmmhh...
01:19:56<Kita> In fact... Kita will get Lilith a body suit, after she is measured...
01:20:07<Kita> And the body suit will have hips and breasts.
01:20:10<Laevos> N-Nngh... ;///////;
01:20:21<Kita> Sound good?
01:20:52<Laevos> Yes...
01:21:21<Kita> And then... Maybe let Lilith try hitting the little bong?
01:22:05<Laevos> Lilith just wants to be beautiful for Kita...
01:22:54<Kita> And Kita wants Lilith to experience euphoria...
01:23:40<Kita> Cuddlin', crossdressed, and high sounds like Lilith's trifecta
01:23:56<Laevos> Euphoria means being beautiful for her goddess... yes cuddling... yes crossdressed... a pretty girl...
01:24:15<Kita> <3
01:25:13<Laevos> I'm yours... just...
01:25:35<Laevos> whatever you want <3
01:26:13<Kita> If Lilith ends up here...
01:26:23<Kita> If this is where Lilith would be okay staying...
01:26:39<Kita> Kita might try to get Lilith's sex changed.
01:27:24<Laevos> good <3
01:28:45<Laevos> make Lilith a woman...
01:29:10<Kita> X3
01:29:33<Kita> But that is quite a ways out, yet
01:29:34<Laevos> Mew, Goddess... I want to submit to you and do whatever you say right now...
01:29:36<Laevos> yes...
01:29:53 Kita: rubs her ears
01:30:25<Kita> Lilith has a life to be lived...
01:31:11 Laevos: nods...
01:31:27<Laevos> just feeling more submissive than I've felt in a long time
01:31:47<Kita> Catnip. :P
01:32:03<Laevos> eat it?
01:32:24<Kita> You were rubbin' on it
01:32:31<Laevos> true
01:32:33<Laevos> does it do that?
01:32:42<Kita> The oils soak in the skin.
01:32:57<Laevos> looks like I got high anyway
01:32:58<Laevos> oh well
01:33:08<Kita> Makes cats susceptible to suggestion/attention.
01:33:34<Laevos> that explains why...
01:33:46<Laevos> oh Goddess...
01:33:51<Laevos> I'll do anything you say right now...
01:35:17 Kita: hands her a large slice of cae and a fork.
01:35:22<Kita> cake*
01:35:37<Kita> Eat this, you'll thank Kita later.
01:35:59 Laevos: starts eating it, bite after bite, a bit stuck on the corner of her mouth as she consumes it... mmh... nnh...
01:36:39<Kita> Being high augments the intensity of your senses.
01:36:52<Kita> Like hot/cold reception, and hunger...
01:37:00<Laevos> I wanna be touched...
01:37:15<Laevos> wanna be felt up and made into Kita's kittytoy...
01:37:20<Laevos> please don't leave me...
01:37:20<Kita> Your brain uses more calories to interpret the new inputs.
01:37:37<Kita> Munchies are a combo of those two things.
01:37:41 Kita: gently pets.
01:38:10<Kita> Awwwr
01:38:13 Laevos: lets out a whimper and spasms
01:38:30<Kita> Why would Kita leave her nost loyal servant
01:38:38<Kita> most*
01:41:17 Kita: rubs up and down her back

12:46:21<Laevos> maybe it just feels humid because I need to shower

19:54:32<Laevos> Kita's a pretty lady, too!
19:54:35<Kita> XP
19:54:37<Laevos> Perhaps they're they same person ;u;
19:54:50<Laevos> That'd be quite the twist o:

19:59:52<Kita> Brendan and May in their Emerald artwork are both holding Premier Balls
20:00:30<Laevos> :3
20:00:32<Laevos> Also omg
20:00:43<Laevos> the cashier at Panera let me get a bread thing for free ;u;
20:00:52<Laevos> that was nice of her
20:01:03<Kita> Oh?
20:01:06<Laevos> Yeah
20:01:10<Laevos> I had already bought a soup and ate it
20:01:18<Laevos> went up and ordered a 'bagel flat' and pulled out my wallet
20:01:18<Kita> Maybe you should ask her out<3
20:01:21<Laevos> she said not to worry about it
20:01:24<Laevos> Maybe I should ask YOU out
20:01:28<Laevos> ;////;
20:01:36<Kita> :P
20:01:41<Laevos> Anyway
20:01:46<Kita> http://1-media-cdn.foolz.us/ffuuka/board/vp/image/1372/44/1372444022586.jpg

20:01:58<Kita> Yeah?
20:02:01<Laevos> Nice :D
20:02:11<Laevos> But it might be aggravating
20:02:17<Laevos> wouldn't want to contribute to that :c
20:02:27<Kita> That is why you don't hit on her.
20:02:55<Kita> Just ask her if she'd like to get lunch sometime and give her your number/e-mail address
20:03:57<Laevos> I dunno
20:04:36<Laevos> just doesn't seem riiiiiight ;n;
20:04:39<Laevos> plus
20:04:50<Kita> It is just fine, sweets
20:05:10<Laevos> Lilith doesn't really have the urge to ask girls out, really... used to ask guys out, that was super fun >n>

20:41:11<Kita> <3
20:41:14<Laevos> <3~!
20:41:17<Laevos> Hmm...
20:41:23<Laevos> I wanna come watch movies with you QnQ
20:41:30<Kita> Are Kita.log and Kitafox.log one, yet?
20:41:30<Laevos> but I suppose some kind of synced streaming thing could
20:41:31<Laevos> work as well
20:41:37<Laevos> not yet xnx
20:41:38<Laevos> BECAUSE
20:41:43<Laevos> I need to update my entire damn OS
20:41:49<Laevos> so that I can get the latest version of gcc
20:41:55<Laevos> because my code has C++11 features in it
20:41:57<Kita> Win7?
20:42:00<Laevos> Debian
20:42:04<Kita> Oh.
20:42:05<Laevos> (for the server)
20:42:08<Kita> Debester
20:42:18<Laevos> just 'cause it's easy to SSH and IRC from
20:42:21<Laevos> so I'll do that when I have time
20:42:35<Laevos> still working on the code now and again
20:42:56<Kita> X3
20:42:59<Laevos> there was one part that looked kind of wrong
20:43:02<Laevos> so I'll go back and try and fix it
20:43:09 Kita: nods.
20:43:14<Kita> Could Kita use it?
20:43:22<Laevos> sure <3
20:43:29<Laevos> you can take a look at what I have so far if you want
20:43:34<Laevos> it's sloppy, but I want to get something that works first
20:43:46<Kita> Oh.
20:43:52<Kita> Kita can't HELP with it
20:43:54<Kita> o.o;
20:43:55<Laevos> oh no
20:44:00<Laevos> that's fine xD
20:44:11<Laevos> also GOD DAMN C++
20:44:21<Laevos> apparently switch statements can only handle FUCKING INTEGERS
20:44:25<Laevos> I tried to use it with strings
20:44:33<Laevos> so instead I'll have to have a very ugly if/else chain
20:45:17<Laevos> Kita has irssi, right?
20:45:47<Kita> No?
20:45:51<Kita> Kita uses mIRC.
20:45:56<Laevos> What do those logs look like? ;n;
20:46:03<Laevos> I can probably adapt it to mIRC logs
20:46:11<Laevos> once I get this version working
20:48:44<Kita> Hmmm...
20:49:08<Laevos> They might even be easier! o:
20:51:17<Kita> Trying!
20:51:25<Kita> They are .log
20:51:27<Kita> But
20:51:33 Kita: is having trouble finding them
20:51:36<Kita> ;.;
20:51:40<Laevos> Awwrh ;n;
20:51:49<Laevos> NO idea where mIRC puts its logs Dx
20:52:21<Kita> Searching C:\
20:57:06 Kita: wiggles.
20:57:10<Kita> It is in AppData.
20:57:49<Laevos> Ooh, okay
20:58:04<Kita> Win7 does not want you to access AppData
20:58:10<Kita> Like... Directly.
20:58:14<Kita> It is difficult to get o
20:58:16<Kita> to*
20:58:43<Laevos> Yeah you have to type it in manually e_e
20:58:46<Laevos> silly OS
20:58:56<Kita> They don't let you do that, anymore.
20:59:24<Laevos> C:\Users\AppData?
20:59:32<Laevos> err
20:59:38<Laevos> Users, then whatever the username
20:59:45<Laevos> /kita/appdata
20:59:46<Kita> You can't type in the address bar of Windows Explorer anymore.
20:59:55<Laevos> I can on mine o_O
21:00:10 Kita: blinks..
21:00:16 Kita: fiddles with her settings.
21:00:31<Laevos> Unless it just changed today or something
21:00:58<Kita> In
21:01:33<Kita> C:\User\User's Name\AppData\Roaming\mIRC\logs
21:01:38<Kita> Is where they are.
21:01:42<Laevos> :3
21:01:48<Laevos> Hmm...
21:02:04<Laevos> if you can send me the one of mine, I could see the format
21:02:13<Kita> It is just .log
21:02:14<Kita> o.o
21:02:18<Laevos> oh, no
21:02:20<Laevos> I mean
21:02:27<Laevos> how the text is laid out in the file
21:02:30<Kita> Oh
21:02:42<Laevos> need to know the timestamp format, how it shows a change in date
21:02:56<Laevos> if there's any special text for when a log opens/closes
21:03:00<Laevos> all that fun stuff
21:03:50<Kita> E-Mail Address
21:04:35<Laevos> iggnsthelive.com
21:04:45<Kita> o.o
21:04:46<Laevos> err
21:04:52<Laevos> iggnsthe@live.com
21:04:53<Laevos> sorry
21:05:13<Laevos> on my phone, the @ symbol is in a different place in ConnectBot
21:05:59<Laevos> that's my personal e-mail, bb
21:06:09<Laevos> so don't sign me up for any porn sites
21:06:15<Laevos> unless they're /really/ hot
21:06:26<Kita> o.o
21:06:38<Kita> Or REEEEEALLY funny?
21:06:39<Kita> :3
21:07:00<Laevos> Sure
21:07:35<Laevos> I do get e-mails from LoveHoney, a sex toy shop, but that's more useful than amusing
21:09:38<Laevos> So, Kita
21:09:43<Kita> ?
21:09:46<Laevos> did you just wake up one day and say
21:10:04<Laevos> "I think I'll be the coolest lady around now 8)"
21:10:24<Kita> Kind of?
21:10:29<Kita> It was less secure, at the time.
21:10:30<Laevos> Really? :o
21:10:56<Laevos> Wel Kita /is/ the coolest Q////Q
21:10:59<Kita> "I'm going to quit being a scrubby tool, and be as awesome as anyone can be."
21:11:04<Laevos> :3
21:11:13<Kita> Before?
21:11:19<Kita> Kita was like a female neckbeard.
21:12:44<Laevos> but deep inside there was a well of coolness waiting to burst forth!!!
21:12:58<Kita> It had to be developed.
21:13:04<Kita> Anyone can be cool.
21:13:11<Kita> They just gotta work towards it.
21:13:17<Kita> Being cool is a state of mind.
21:13:30<Kita> If you think you're cool, you probably aren't.
21:13:40<Kita> But if you ARE cool, you probably are.
21:13:47<Laevos> xD
21:14:04<Kita> It is all about not caring about how the outside perceives you.
21:14:08<Laevos> I'm prett uncool, let's not split hairs about that
21:14:13<Kita> It is about how you perceive yourself.
21:14:37<Kita> Okay
21:14:45<Kita> Don't talk for a few minutes, okay?
21:15:04<Kita> We keep updating the .log and it doesn't load
21:15:05<Kita> XD
21:16:04<Kita> Nevermind
21:16:14<Kita> The Laevos_.log had stuff in it.
21:16:20<Laevos> Oh okay :3

21:34:49<Laevos> xD
21:35:29<Kita> :3
21:36:00<Laevos> I had Ruby xwx

21:37:33<Laevos> IN GLORIOUS TRUMPETS
21:41:21<Laevos> Mew! I'm excited for more trumpety goodness
21:41:41<Laevos> and for Kita's continued existence!
21:41:48<Kita> o.o
21:42:20<Laevos> ''cause Kita's just the best
21:42:44<Laevos> and Lilith got super-attached last night, still feeling some of the afterglow from that
21:42:47<Laevos> STILL
21:43:16<Kita> o.o
21:43:32<Laevos> Is true owo
21:43:58<Kita> http://chipsprites.tumblr.com/post/85045624804/omega-ruby-alpha-sapphire-x
21:45:51<Laevos> #X and Y ain't shit compared to this
21:45:53<Laevos> HOW RUDE
21:46:11<Kita> X&Y are good...
21:46:16<Kita> But the post-game was lacking.
21:46:24<Laevos> Oh, okay
21:46:31<Kita> It was intended to encourage old players to explore the new meta-game...
21:46:41<Kita> And to encourage new players to TRY the meta-game.
21:48:13<Laevos> Ooh

21:56:30<Laevos> Hmmm
21:56:32<Laevos> got the logs
21:56:41<Laevos> only thing is it doesn't show seconds, so lots of things in the same minute
21:56:42<Laevos> buuuuuut
21:56:44<Laevos> I suppoooose...
21:57:00<Laevos> it's unlikely (though not unheard of...) for there to be messages in both logs at the same minue
21:57:02<Laevos> *minute
21:57:33<Kita> o.o
21:58:10<Laevos> just thinking out potential issues ;n;
22:00:08<Kita> o.o
22:00:44<Laevos> Sorry if I'm freaking you out, Q_Q
22:00:47<Laevos> but like
22:00:58<Laevos> to put two logs together, gotta think of it as interleaving pages
22:01:08<Laevos> goes back and forth between the two; if it was just one and then the other, that'd be easy
22:01:20<Kita> Yes.
22:01:26<Kita> Kita understands that.
22:01:37<Laevos> hmhmhm
22:01:37<Kita> O.O = something is wrong
22:01:41<Laevos> what's wrong? Dx
22:01:46<Kita> o.o = You have Kita's attention
22:01:49<Laevos> Oh okay
22:02:03<Kita> Kita is staring, intently.
22:02:08<Kita> Absorbing the words.
22:02:11<Laevos> Good to know!
22:02:17<Laevos> Lilith has happyshivers from having Kita's attention
22:02:18<Laevos> hmm...
22:02:26<Kita> X3
22:02:40<Laevos> I suppose... the messages would be read in the order that they show up...
22:02:47<Laevos> so the messages within a lot won't get mixed up, at any rate
22:03:09<Laevos> guess it's unlikely that too many messages will happen within the same minute
22:03:41<Laevos> and at any rate, at that point there isn't much that can be done, the data simply doesn't provide the means to discern between one log's messages and another at the second-to-second level
22:05:35 Kita: could add seconds to her timestamp
22:05:59<Laevos> I suppose so!
22:06:06<Laevos> But that wouldn't retroactively add them, unfortunately
22:06:11<Kita> No.
22:06:15<Kita> It wouldn't.
22:06:33<Kita> But when mIRC finally kicks Kita off, she is going to switch to Ghalerion.
22:06:37<Kita> Well
22:06:43 Laevos: looks it up
22:06:46<Kita> Ghalerion Ultimate Blade Works Script.
22:06:50<Kita> You won't find it.
22:06:58<Laevos> Oh okay
22:07:01<Laevos> yeah I just found some RP forum
22:07:29<Laevos> So, no idea what you're talking about! ;n;
22:07:37<Kita> http://s1.zetaboards.com/DivineLotus/topic/3250723/1/
22:07:39<Kita> Found it.
22:07:47<Kita> Unlimited Blade Works, actually.
22:08:15<Laevos> Oh okay :3
22:08:17<Laevos> Yay :3
22:08:47<Kita> It is... a heavily altered mIRC.
22:08:52<Laevos> Oh okay
22:08:55<Laevos> With lasers?
22:08:58<Kita> HEAVILY altered.
22:09:04<Laevos> :333333
22:11:18<Laevos> Is it the coolest?
22:11:30<Kita> It is pretty cool.
22:11:36<Kita> It is an old roleplaying script.
22:14:26<Laevos> Huh
22:14:28<Laevos> what does it let you do?
22:14:30<Laevos> LASERS?
22:14:44<Kita> It has an anti-cut script.
22:17:57<Kita> Also, improved colour options.
22:18:05<Kita> COLOURS
22:18:11<Laevos> Yeah xD
22:18:17<Kita> SO MANY COLOURS
22:18:19<Laevos> too bad that puts weirdo characters into my logs! :'c
22:18:26<Kita> COOOOOOLOURS

22:19:27<Kita> There are notpastels, too.
22:19:35<Laevos> apparently not :'c
22:19:38<Kita> o.o
22:19:42<Kita> What?
22:19:54<Laevos> Maybe they show up differently on this screen
22:19:57<Laevos> actually nvm
22:19:59<Laevos> the blue wasn't
22:20:10<Kita> There is red?
22:20:21<Kita> And orangish brown
22:20:55<Laevos> True

22:25:18<Kita> KILL COLD COLD
22:25:20<Laevos> That one's pretty good
22:25:20<Laevos> err
22:25:22<Laevos> Chaos of...
22:25:27<Laevos> kill cold cold is just silly
22:25:31<Kita> It is
22:25:38<Kita> Kita would name a joke band that.
22:25:49<Kita> Ancient Noise Infernal
22:26:07<Kita> DEMON OF SUFFER THRASH
22:26:14<Kita> Oh god
22:26:19<Kita> Fuck at Human Psycho

22:27:07<Kita> Christ of Ritual Christ
22:27:09<Laevos> xD
22:27:46<Kita> The best names come from 2 and 3
22:28:12<Kita> Raven of Steel
22:28:20<Kita> Obviously an Emo Thrash Metal band.
22:28:40<Kita> TORMENT AT TORMENT
22:28:49<Laevos> HAHAHAHAH XD
22:28:56<Laevos> Now you're getting into ESL metal territory
22:29:05<Kita> :P
22:29:29<Kita> HAND STEEL
22:29:36<Laevos> thought Christ of Ritual Christ is up there, too
22:29:37<Laevos> LOL
22:30:00<Kita> SHADOW LIGHT
22:30:09<Kita> "What a stupid name!"
22:30:55<Kita> "Okay. Now we're gonna play our new song for our friend in the crowd here... Fuck Your Mother With The Redeemer's Chainsaw Dick"
22:31:07<Laevos> :3
22:31:23<Kita> (That is how silly, over the top, off the wall, death metal works, right?)
22:31:53<Laevos> :3
22:31:56<Laevos> More or less, I think
22:32:03<Kita> Serpent of Serpent.
22:32:04<Laevos> most of the death metal that I listen to is from the '90s
22:32:06<Laevos> xD
22:32:23<Kita> What about ironic death metal
22:32:35<Laevos> Hoopsters
22:32:44<Kita> Where they use the style to sing about petting cute puppies and doing their homework?
22:32:53<Laevos> That's gross :c
22:32:59<Laevos> Not a shred of artistic integrity! :'c
22:33:08<Kita> It is hilarious, is what it is.
22:33:27<Kita> Because some people like petting cute puppies and doing things like homework.
22:34:02<Laevos> :c
22:34:26 Kita: is just imagining it
22:34:34<Laevos> True
22:34:39<Laevos> is that what YOU'RE going to sing about?
22:35:09<Kita> Actually, Kita would probably create metaphorical pieces on existentialism and the inevitable heatdeath of all things.
22:35:10<Kita> o.o
22:35:19<Kita> Also
22:35:27<Kita> The heatdeath of the universe is pretty metal.
22:35:40<Laevos> that's good
22:35:42<Laevos> and yeah
22:35:43<Laevos> that's like
22:35:45<Laevos> what Wormed sing about
22:36:24<Kita> One day we will all be wibbly wobbly plasma beams being sucked into black holes.
22:36:45<Laevos> :3
22:38:30 Kita: wibblewobbles
22:39:50 Laevos: squiggles

22:48:38<Laevos> <3
22:48:49<Laevos> last thing I have to do is like
22:48:54<Laevos> give my presentation tomorrow
22:49:01<Laevos> (then papers and finals for next week)
22:50:17<Kita> o.o
22:50:22<Laevos> Hehehe
22:50:25<Laevos> it never ends ;w;
22:50:32<Kita> You gonna pass all the classes
22:50:32<Laevos> only get two weeks or so of summer break this time around
22:50:35<Laevos> of course
22:50:40<Kita> Good girl
22:50:41<Kita> <3
22:50:47<Kita> Good to see Kita is no detriment
22:50:54<Laevos> :3 Kita is helpful~
22:51:09<Laevos> however... there is one class that Lilith will probably get a B at best in :c
22:51:23<Laevos> just not that good at Earthquakes and Natural Disasters
22:53:03<Kita> That shit is depressing
22:53:29<Laevos> yeah
22:53:56<Laevos> useful class, teaches you about causes, how to protect yourself, how to shop for houses in areas with those kinds of problems... >_>
22:54:18<Laevos> But yes, lots of "...and many were killed" kinds of things
22:54:19<Kita> Is it really useful?
22:54:23<Laevos> I dunno
22:54:26<Laevos> it's a requirement!
22:54:32<Laevos> I mean, it fulfills a requirement
22:54:47<Laevos> so it's useful in that sense, it helps me graduate!
22:54:49<Laevos> :P
22:55:10 Kita: chews on her handpaw
22:55:13<Kita> Itchy hands...
22:55:16<Laevos> Eep...
22:55:21<Kita> Stupid repetitive muscle disorders
22:55:23<Kita> x.x
22:55:26<Laevos> Mewmew Q_Q
22:55:30<Laevos> That sounds very aggravating Dx
22:55:37<Kita> (Early onset carpal tunnel, probably..)
22:55:42<Laevos> Ugh...
22:55:44 Kita: puts on her braces
22:55:45<Laevos> I'm sorry, Goddess Dx
22:58:19 Kita: turns on speech-to-text
22:58:37<Kita> Sorry, Kita just can't type right now.
22:58:42<Laevos> It's okay! Dx
22:58:52<Kita> There are bound to be errors, though.
22:59:03<Laevos> It's okay, Goddess... ;n;
22:59:07<Laevos> I love you! Dx
22:59:53 Kita: sprinkles sugar on Lilith
23:00:13 Laevos: is a sweet kitty? <3
23:00:19<Kita> Yush
23:00:39<Laevos> Kita deserves understanding and compassion Q_Q
23:03:09<Kita> Alakazam has two spoons.
23:03:20<Kita> Vanilluxe came in Gen V. It foresaw it.
23:03:31<Laevos> ...xD
23:03:31<Kita> Gen VI? Alakazam gets a Mega Evolution.
23:03:35<Kita> With FIVE SPOONS
23:03:36<Laevos> MORE SPOONS
23:03:47<Laevos> MORE ICE CREAM
23:03:47<Kita> It developed a more deadly technique.
23:04:00<Laevos> super-effective against Vanilluxe... xux
23:04:51<Kita> X3
23:05:03<Laevos> but you know what that means...
23:05:38<Laevos> Vanilluxe mega-evolution confirmed
23:08:07<Kita> https://i.chzbgr.com/maxW500/6288294912/hF68C031B/
23:08:42<Laevos> xD
23:11:07 Kita: is working on her Ghost Gym Leader profile... Might stick with Psychic, still.
23:11:32<Laevos> Ooh o;
23:14:40<Kita> Yeah
23:15:12<Kita> Team Galactic is interesting, in their fall...
23:15:23<Kita> A lot of members outright quit and disappear.
23:15:32<Kita> They are just done.
23:15:45<Kita> They re-integrate into society and don't talk about it.
23:15:49<Laevos> Yeah o:
23:15:55<Kita> The others? They become Galactic Power.
23:16:11<Kita> Using Solar Power to give power to Sinnoh
23:16:54<Kita> Kita's theory...
23:17:05<Kita> Pokemon Platinum is the canonical instance.
23:17:13<Kita> Game's final canon of Sinnoh is Platinum
23:17:52<Kita> Where Giratina comes in and begins wreaking havoc and sucking Cyrus into the Torn World.
23:18:03<Laevos> Perhaps ouo
23:18:54<Kita> Theory: Giratina sucked in every member of Galactic that was at Mt. Coronet. The survivors were traumatised. They spend their entire lives trying to forget. This is why some left Galactic and some didn't.
23:19:23<Kita> Not every member was at Mt. Coronet.
23:22:03<Kita> Kita's Psychic Gym Leader was... And due to the chaotic nature of the Torn World, she was able to navigate it, somewhat, with her latent psychic powers.
23:22:19<Kita> When she was spat back out?
23:22:38<Kita> She wasn't deposited where she was picked up... She was deposited somewhere else.
23:22:47<Kita> She had traveled too far.
23:23:29<Laevos> Hmm...
23:27:54<Kita> The character's name is Vul Alpecula
23:28:38<Kita> (Inspired by the minor constellation... Vulpecula, and the brightest star in it: α Vulpeculae)
23:29:51<Kita> (Her title, when she moves to the league becomes Gym Leader Alpha V, a la Crasher Wake style~)
23:30:01<Kita> (So much Gen IV reference~)
23:32:43<Laevos> Yay, beat a monofighting with my monodark :3
23:33:40<Kita> What is on your monodark?
23:33:59<Laevos> http://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/oumonotype-117705968
23:34:07<Laevos> Needs some tweaks
23:35:09<Laevos> But that goddamn greninja, yo :D
23:35:13<Kita> FFR: Poison, Burn, Paralysis, Freeze, and Sleep do not stack
23:35:24<Laevos> Yeah, I know o:
23:35:34<Laevos> oh right
23:35:38<Laevos> I forgot about the toxic orb
23:35:43<Kita> If one has one, they cannot get another.
23:35:45<Laevos> too sleepy to notice
23:35:46<Laevos> yeah
23:36:44<Laevos> Fucking Greninja ;u;
23:37:50<Kita> Two Toxic Spikes when possible
23:37:51<Kita> <3
23:37:56<Laevos> Yeah, I wanted to, but
23:37:59<Laevos> just wanted to KILL
23:38:02<Kita> Also, Poison resists Fighting.
23:38:07<Laevos> Ah okay
23:38:12<Laevos> I knew there was some type interaction between those two
23:38:14<Laevos> BUT I FORGOT
23:38:20<Kita> So KEEP TOXIC SPIKES AT ALL COSTS
23:38:24<Laevos> duhh h:3
23:38:27<Laevos> it's 2op
23:38:52<Kita> TheEndOfAllDay just laughs at it, because Flying~
23:38:58<Laevos> Yeah :3
23:40:04<Kita> How dick would it be for a Cosmic Power Sigilyph to be on an in-game Gym Leader team
23:40:10<Laevos> xD
23:40:13<Laevos> Dickilicious
23:41:36<Kita> All FEAR-style Pokemon fear TheEndOfAllDay

12:43:07<Kita> 5.0
12:44:20<Laevos> FIVE POINT ZERO o:
12:45:12<Kita> http://i.imgur.com/wSzWprR.jpg
12:46:16<Laevos> "The patriarchy" ok
12:47:19<Kita> "The Patriarchy" is an organisation in certain conspiracies that is dedicated to keeping women and children subservient and oppressed. No such organisation ACTUALLY exists.
12:48:14<Laevos> Obviously patriarchy is actually an institutionalized force that does aim to keep the balance of power in favor of white, het, cis, able-bodied males.
12:48:25<Laevos> That's beyond question.
12:48:38<Kita> Yes, but it isn't a world power organisation.
12:48:41<Laevos> There's not an organization that I'm aware of that calls themselves 'the patriarchy', but it's without a doubt a fource that exists.
12:48:50<Laevos> I've heard claims that it is exactly... zero times
12:48:59<Laevos> so what exactly are they aiming to debunk...?
12:49:05<Kita> You don't hang out with enough conspiracy theorists.
12:49:13<Laevos> Sounds like some kind of crypt-MRA bullshit.
12:49:17<Kita> Specifically, feminazi conspiracy theorists.
12:49:28<Laevos> I can't take any phrase containing 'feminazi' seriously.
12:49:33<Kita> (Not feminist conspiracy theorists, feminazi.)
12:49:45<Laevos> That's such an annoying term.
12:49:47<Kita> Kita uses the term to refer Female Supremicists.
12:49:48<Laevos> I wish people would stop using it.
12:50:04<Kita> Feminists are Female Equalists.
12:50:06<Laevos> It's so very, very irritating, and so very, very wrong, in so very, very many ways.
12:50:21<Kita> Oi.
12:50:31<Laevos> Honestly decent feminisms need to be about much  more than just equality.
12:50:44<Laevos> "Can't we just treat everyone the same?" is a common defense used by dumbass frat boys.
12:51:35<Kita> Everyone needs to be treated the same, regardless of gender, race, or religion, etc.
12:51:48<Kita> This means... Everyone gets the same opportunities.
12:51:58<Laevos> People need to be treated according to their need.
12:52:02<Laevos> That does not always mean the same thing.
12:52:21<Kita> It does mean getting the same opportunities.
12:52:53<Laevos> "Treating everyone the same" is often rhetoric used to get rid of things like affirmative action.
12:53:35<Kita> Alright, alright.
12:53:37<Kita> You win.
12:53:43<Laevos> :/
12:53:47<Laevos> It's not about winning, just... ugh
12:53:47<Kita> Kita worded her things clumsily.
12:54:00<Laevos> if you seriously think that there exist a group of people that can legitimately be called 'feminazis'
12:54:07<Kita> Female Supremicists.
12:54:11<Laevos> Lilith, without a shadow of a doubt, would belong to that group.
12:54:29<Laevos> 100% anti-fun, for one thing.
12:54:35<Kita> Lilith is not a Female Supremicist.
12:54:35<Kita> :P
12:54:59<Laevos> You should stop using the word 'feminazi'.
12:55:06<Laevos> Obviously I can't do anything to force you to, but you really should.
12:55:09<Laevos> At the very least, around me.
12:55:33<Kita> You're ignoring Kita's definition of the term.
12:55:46<Laevos> Your personal definiton doesn't erase the definition that society holds of the term
12:55:49<Kita> Or at least, not commenting on it.
12:56:02<Laevos> using it, even in your own way, simply enables the general use of the term as it is regularly used.
12:56:20<Kita> This is why Kita doesn't use it open forum...
12:56:27<Laevos> Your own private definition is, frankly, not really that important here. You don't decide how others will interpret the term, which is what is important.
12:56:53<Kita> Earlier, you will see that Kita redefined it, in using it.
12:57:02<Laevos> Yes, I do see that
12:57:16<Laevos> but that redefinition /does not matter/ because the overriding definition preceeds it in how it is interpreted
12:57:30<Laevos> besides that, it's fairly triggering for me, and quite disrupitive of my emotional equilibrium
12:57:35<Laevos> so while I can't control how you speak to others
12:57:58<Laevos> I would at least ask that you abstain from  using it directly in my presence, especially when I'm the sole other participant in this discussion.
12:58:50<Kita> Kita just thinks feminists should take the word back, so that they can distance themselves from the extremists who caused the word to be created in the first place.
12:59:11<Laevos> I am an extremist.
13:00:52<Laevos> I can see no fruition in feminisms taking such attacking rhetoric if they're simply going to use it to attack others themselves.
13:01:14<Laevos> Further, I really can't envision any positive spin on a term that contains 'nazi'.
13:01:29<Laevos> It will almost surely remain perjorative, wherever it is used.
13:01:48<Kita> Nazis were supremicists. Supremicism is inherently counteractive to the goals of feminism.
13:02:05<Laevos> Are you or are you not going to stop using that term around me?
13:02:13<Kita> Probably.
13:02:16<Laevos> Good.
13:02:34<Laevos> I appreciate the gesture of consideration.
13:06:54<Laevos> But no, I don't think that even feminists should be allowed to trivialize the holocaust and other atrocities comitted by the Nazi regime by using such a term, ever. Not something that they can 'take back'.
13:07:55<Kita> Trivialising the holocaust would be like the GOP the holocaust of the civil rights movement.
13:08:03<Kita> like calling the*
13:08:14<Kita> Which is obviously a huge over-exaggeration.
13:08:18<Kita> And probably not true.
13:09:12<Kita> The only thing comparable to it, as far as civil rights goes, would be the amount of women killed in the Middle East over their backwards law systems, and doctrines of oppression towards women.
13:09:52<Kita> Because if we had those numbers? It would probably be equally disgusting. Women who literally have rocks thrown at them until they die.
13:09:58<Kita> That is torture.
13:10:43<Kita> Often, when they have not actually done anything wrong.
13:13:20<Laevos> The fact still remains that invoking the Nazis is equivalent to invoking their atrocities.
13:13:46<Laevos> A belief that women are superior to men doesn't come close in even a single substantial way.
13:13:51<Laevos> It never will, either.
13:14:18<Kita> That all said...
13:14:31<Kita> Women are not superior to men.
13:14:45<Laevos> That doesn't make it okay to invoke the term Nazi to refer to people who hold that belief.
13:15:02<Kita> That has already been established.
13:16:18<Laevos> Men certainly are disgusting creatures... I'm no exception to that rule, perhaps it'd just be better if I were to give my life in voluntary extinction...
13:16:38<Laevos> can't hope for others to do the same, but it's more a symbolic gesture
13:16:45<Kita> That would be ineffective.
13:16:55<Kita> The symbolism would be lost.
13:16:56<Laevos> like voting for a third-party candidate, it's the thought that counts...

01:45:13 Laevos: kisses <3
01:45:25<Kita> Pre-ordered Alpha Sapphire, and watched both The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and Captain America 2: The Winter Soldier
01:46:08<Kita> Captain America is such a simple guy. He just wants to do the right thing, and wants to understand people.
01:46:14<Kita> Super respectful to women...
01:46:21<Kita> He is just pretty cool.
01:46:25<Laevos> AMERICA
01:46:40<Kita> Hey
01:46:54<Kita> He wears the name people gave him, not the name he chose.
01:46:59<Kita> He doesn't complain.
01:47:19<Laevos> :3
01:47:24<Kita> Cap is cool.
01:47:29 Kita: likes Captain America.
01:47:46<Kita> Also
01:48:33<Kita> He politely tells Nick Fury, on multiple occasions, that he isn't going to follow certain orders, or tolerate his troop being "compartmentalised"
01:49:52<Kita> Nick Fury isn't someone you just bark at.
01:50:13<Kita> But Cap will sit there and tell him "No." when no one else will.
01:51:40<Kita> Also
01:51:52<Kita> Electro
01:51:54<Kita> Sadface
01:51:58<Laevos> sadface
01:52:17<Kita> Paranoid schizo with illusions of grandeur.
01:52:23<Laevos> Oh okay
01:52:29<Laevos> I don't know annnnnnnnnyyyyyything about that universe
01:52:34<Kita> WELL

01:53:04<Kita> Spidey is a witty badass
01:53:11<Kita> Cap is a polite badass
01:53:21<Kita> Iron Man is Robert Downey Jr.
01:53:36<Laevos> xD
01:53:40<Kita> And Thor is a lightning god.
01:53:41<Laevos> I thought you were talking about the comics
01:53:47<Laevos> not the damnable movies :'c
01:53:48<Kita> Well
01:53:52<Laevos> (Which I also haven't seen)
01:53:59<Kita> Iron Man IS Robert Downey Jr., now.
01:54:03<Laevos> IRL?
01:54:43<Kita> In the most recent comics? Stark bears a hilariously uncanny resemblence to everyone's favourite Sherlock.
01:55:00<Kita> (Also, RDJ sings. Very, very well.)
01:55:06<Laevos> Man I thought that Sherlock Holmes movie with him was totes shitty :c
01:55:23<Kita> It certainly wasn't reliable to the literature.
01:55:29<Kita> But who cares! Witty RDJ!
01:55:31<Laevos> I've never read the books
01:55:37<Laevos> I don't like that guy :c
01:55:48 Kita: does.
01:55:54<Kita> His acting is tremendous.
01:55:56<Laevos> He stole my lunch money!
01:55:59<Kita> (Never watched Sherlock.)
01:56:26<Kita> But he did a movie with Galifinakis that was absolutely hilarious.
01:56:35<Laevos> what movie was that?
01:56:49<Kita> Don't remember the name. Brother brought it over once.
01:56:55<Kita> Almost didn't watch it.
01:56:59<Kita> Kita hates Galifinakis.
01:57:07<Laevos> The name sounds like one of those
01:57:12<Laevos> gross white dudes that are in movies nowadays
01:57:52<Kita> Zack Galifinakis? Yeah. He is gross. Also an asshole in an awkward way. Like he is a jackass and stupid in an on-purpose, ironic way.
01:58:03<Laevos> Gross
01:58:29<Kita> And RDJ counters it with trying really hard to be indifferent, only to end up being constantly frustrated.
01:58:52<Laevos> and then kills him in real life?
01:58:56<Kita> Kita wishes.
01:59:05<Kita> But no.
01:59:27<Kita> The guy just... won't leave. And RDJ can't get away.
01:59:39<Kita> So he just has to accept that he is stuck with him.
01:59:43<Laevos> :c
01:59:57<Kita> But the emotions feel very real.
02:00:02<Kita> It is a good movie.
02:00:21<Laevos> not like those ROBOT emotions?
02:00:36<Kita> You know how Cabin in the Woods starts out like a B-rate Horror film but grows into so much more?
02:00:52<Laevos> I don't know ANYTHING
02:00:54<Laevos> about anything ;w;
02:01:11<Kita> The movie is called Due Date
02:01:26<Kita> If you hate it, blame Kita.
02:01:27<Kita> X3
02:01:34<Laevos> I probz won't watch it tbh
02:01:38<Kita> Awwwr.
02:01:43<Laevos> is it a /comedy/?
02:01:57<Kita> Yeah.
02:02:05<Laevos> But I don't like thooose :c
02:02:10<Kita> But it isn't... like.. trying hard to be funny.
02:02:12<Kita> It is just funny.
02:02:17<Laevos> that makes no difference to me! :c
02:02:28<Kita> It isn't like The Hangover where they go way over the top...
02:02:30<Laevos> I'm not someone who goes and plays a game against someone and then if they win just go
02:02:33<Laevos> OMG U TRYHARD
02:02:42<Laevos> I had to see The Hangover
02:02:50<Laevos> that's what I get for visiting my dad
02:02:53<Kita> o.o
02:02:59<Kita> It isn't very good.
02:03:05<Laevos> It was very bad.
02:03:11<Kita> It just... goes too far and doesn't deliver in the end.
02:03:19<Laevos> Like all of the things wrong with the world packed up into a little blob of shit.
02:03:46<Laevos> POOP ON A PLATE
02:03:50<Laevos> A PLATE THAT IS ALSO MADE OUT OF POOP
02:03:51<Kita> It sets up these elaborate jokes, and the punchline is super weak and watered-down.
02:03:51<Laevos> etc.
02:03:56<Laevos> anyway
02:04:02<Laevos> I don't like comedies as a general rule
02:04:04<Kita> Like the dentist losing his tooth.
02:04:22<Kita> WELL
02:04:32<Kita> KITA DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF FUNNY FRIENDS
02:04:35<Kita> D:
02:04:41<Laevos> :c
02:04:50<Laevos> neither does Lilith anymore
02:04:52<Kita> And Kita likes to laugh.
02:04:57 Laevos: tickles
02:05:00<Laevos> or not
02:05:03<Kita> Lilith has Kita, and Kita is the funniest.
02:05:06<Laevos> :3
02:08:57<Laevos> perhaps so <3
02:10:17 Kita: nibbles
02:10:21 Laevos: nuzzles on
02:14:46<Laevos> Lilith wants to be with people ;-;
02:14:48<Laevos> and cuddle

02:15:21<Laevos> Yes xnx
02:15:26<Laevos> not currently possible though ;n;

03:25:52<Laevos> Sleepy?
03:26:03<Kita> No
03:26:07<Kita> Hypoglycemic
03:26:23<Kita> Started crashing, overcorrected, sugar high, crashing again.
03:26:39<Laevos> Oh gosh x______x
03:26:42<Laevos> that's horrible ;n;
03:27:35<Kita> You need to learn how to braid hair.
03:27:37<Kita> Got it?
03:27:46<Laevos> Yes ma'am! <3
03:27:49<Laevos> I'll do my best
03:27:53<Laevos> I know people have told me how
03:27:58<Laevos> I'm just /so bad/ at it
03:27:59<Laevos> so like
03:28:03<Laevos> you make three strands
03:28:10<Laevos> and you switch  which ones you fold over in whatever order
03:28:23<Kita> Kita just does it. She doesn't consciously remember her technique.
03:29:39<Kita> But doing it with shaky hands is impossible
03:29:47<Kita> Typing is difficult, too.
03:30:42<Laevos> Awwh...
03:30:46<Laevos> Need to switch to voice?
03:30:58<Kita> No.
03:31:24<Kita> Just note: When Kita says she is switching to voice, be reminded of her crippling fear of recording equipment
03:31:51<Laevos> Yeah ;n; I will, Goddess! Dx
03:31:56<Laevos> And I'm sorry it's necessary at times Q_Q
03:32:51<Kita> Kita was trying to work on the articulation of her sapphire golem.
03:33:14 Laevos: nods
03:33:35<Kita> Hands are too shaky now.
03:33:45<Laevos> ;-;
03:34:03<Kita> Crashes are bad
03:34:23 Laevos: kisses Kita's hands and nuzzles against
03:34:29<Kita> If they aren't handled right, they either ensure another crash, or cause Kita to pass out.
03:34:58<Kita> (Kita wakes up, and probably has about an hour or two before she passes out again, and then she requires medical attention.)
03:35:15<Laevos> Eep x_x
03:35:45<Kita> And if Kita doesn't recover within the first two days? She'll probably have permanent brain damage.
03:35:45<Kita> :<
03:35:52<Kita> But...
03:36:11 Kita: handled the second one right, she hopes.
03:36:29<Laevos> I hope so too Dx
03:36:37<Kita> If she passes out once, and then fixes the problem? She is sluggish and foggy for a few days.
03:37:18<Laevos> Mewp... xnx
03:37:43 Laevos: hugs on
03:38:01<Kita> Recovering from the whole "brain shuts off without power" thing
03:38:02<Kita> :<
03:38:07<Kita> Which is never fun.
03:38:15 Kita: much prefers proper crash handling.
03:38:37<Kita> Is genetic, though.
03:38:39<Kita> So...
03:38:48<Kita> Kita is genetically immune to diabetes!
03:38:49<Kita> :3
03:38:53<Laevos> Well that's good!
03:38:54<Laevos> @_@
03:39:44 Kita: rubs on her belly...
03:40:00<Kita> Be good, tummy... Kita isn't in the mood for your bullshit, right now.
03:40:24<Laevos> Oh no... be good for Goddess, Kitatummy Dx

12:19:22<Laevos> Or against a team with an actual capacity to do damage, which my shitty one does not have :P

12:24:07<Laevos> o:
12:24:16<Laevos> o rly?
12:24:42<Kita> Higher defense.

20:37:49<Kita> Shit, let's be disc jockies.
20:38:36<Laevos> Okay :3
20:38:53<Kita> XP
20:40:36<Laevos> I believe in us xux
20:43:09<Kita> Alright
20:43:17<Kita> You load up the web page...
20:43:30<Kita> And you see an Aegislash swith to Blade forme.
20:43:54<Kita> It then spins its shields between its tassels and then slams it on to a turn table.
20:44:27<Kita> It does a few quick disc needle scratches, then it turns around and the camera recenters on it...
20:44:40<Laevos> xD
20:45:17<Kita> Then you hear "Everyday I'm Shufflin'" and then "AEGISLASH USED SWORDS DANCE" begins flashing above it while it dances to a loop of Guile
20:45:21<Kita> 's Theme.
20:49:04<Kita> AEGISLASH. STOP HIDING BEHIND YOUR SHIELD.

21:02:25<Kita> Aegislash is Kita's bro.
21:02:35<Laevos> Indeed ;3
21:02:41<Laevos> broz4lyfe?
21:02:43<Kita> Is soooo good
21:03:23<Laevos> srsly is
21:04:04<Kita> Lilith should consider replacing the Goodra with it, mayber?
21:04:06<Kita> Maybe*
21:04:16<Laevos> Maybe!
21:04:59<Kita> Lilith should very much consider weather, newer Pokemon, and Sweepers
21:05:06<Kita> Specifically, Anchor Sweepers.
21:05:07<Laevos> ya ;n;
21:05:21<Kita> Pokemon with high power and priority.
21:05:25<Kita> Aegislash has both.
21:06:10<Laevos> Yus ouo
21:06:27<Kita> Dragon Dance Kingdra is an option.
21:07:15<Laevos> That's true
21:07:42<Kita> Mach Punch, Iron Fist Conkeldurr is good, but Ghost-types would be a problem.
21:07:46<Kita> And Talonflame.
21:08:00<Laevos> Yus xux
21:08:09<Kita> Aerial Ace Talonflame works, too!
21:08:12<Laevos> :3
21:08:22<Kita> Aerial Ace can't mist, and Gale Wings gives priority.
21:08:31<Kita> You've got a LOT of options for anchor sweepers.
21:08:55 Kita: knows Lilith likes her walls.

21:32:20<Laevos> :3
21:32:24<Kita> Aegislash is so badass OTHER POKEMON want to use him in battle.
21:32:28<Laevos> YEP
21:32:43<Laevos> ...can Aegislash learn Helping Hand?
21:33:23<Laevos> doesn't look like it Q_Q
21:33:39<Laevos> I guess that'd just be TOO COOL
21:37:26<Kita> But Aegislash can be Helping Handed.
21:37:44<Laevos> true...
21:37:47<Laevos> that makes more sense :D
21:37:50<Kita> Which would be more thematically correct, in this case.
21:37:51<Kita> X3
21:37:55<Laevos> >u>
21:38:03<Laevos> it's canon
21:38:21<Kita> Aegislash doesn't help other Pokemon. Other Pokemon help Aegislash.
21:38:48<Kita> SO
21:38:56<Kita> In Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness
21:39:04<Kita> There are these things called Battle CDs.
21:39:35<Kita> After you beat each Battle CD, you get an item.
21:39:48<Kita> If you beat them all, you get something, if Kita remembers right.
21:39:58<Kita> But
21:40:15<Kita> On each Battle CD is a simulated battle.
21:40:26<Kita> You're given a team, the AI has a team...
21:40:36<Kita> You have a certain condition to complete.
21:41:02<Kita> One of them is called "Donphan Doldrums"
21:41:08<Laevos> ouo
21:41:43<Kita> Where if you don't do the right thing before you have your Donphan use Earthquake, you won't complete the battle within the turn limit.
21:41:47<Kita> (Some have turn limits)
21:42:00<Kita> They are ultimately a more complex test of your skills as a trainer.
21:42:55<Laevos> Ooh
21:42:57<Laevos> nice :D
21:43:08<Kita> You have to use a Level 5 Rattata to beat a Level 100 Shuckle on one disc.
21:43:32<Kita> The thing is?
21:43:53<Kita> There are still random things, like Critical hits, or confusion, or paralysis.
21:44:00<Kita> Those all still exist and ping accordingly.
21:44:13<Kita> Which means you can lose if the battle isn't exactly perfect.
21:44:52<Kita> Kita has only managed to beat every disc on the first try 1 time.
21:46:39<Laevos> Wow o_o
21:49:56<Kita> Fifty battles in a row with no crits? Yeah.
21:49:58<Kita> Not happening
21:50:19<Kita> Sometimes, getting a critical hit is BAD
21:50:35<Kita> Because it triggers the next phase in the AI's strategy early.
21:50:43<Laevos> Yeah ;-;
21:53:51 Kita: licks
21:54:15<Kita> And it is actually 52 battles.
21:54:19<Kita> No wait
21:54:28 Kita: counts.
21:54:32<Kita> It is only 50.

01:46:19<Laevos> :3
01:46:23<Laevos> They are pretty comfy... :3
01:46:31<Laevos> I liked to curl up in the shower room and fall asleep...
01:46:36<Laevos> it contained my body quite snugly
01:47:07 Kita: has enough room for her bed, and some small electronics in her bedroom
01:47:49<Kita> A space heater, her laptop, and an air conditioner

02:08:20<Laevos> If there's a gene for "Being the awesomest Goddess", Kita definitely has it.
02:08:33<Kita> Have issues with absorption and fabrication of cholesterol
02:11:25<Kita> Which basically means cholesterol will never be Kita's problem.

02:11:47<Laevos> Eep @_@
02:12:00<Kita> Some days? Kita doesn't need to eat much.
02:12:12<Kita> Those days she takes sugar pills for hypoglycemia.
02:12:17<Kita> Other days?
02:12:41<Kita> Kita devours massive amounts of everything.
02:12:45<Kita> She is ravenous

04:16:46<Kita> Someone caught a Shiny Raikou in HG.
04:16:50<Kita> Named it ZIPZAPCAT
04:17:20<Kita> They transferred it to Gen VI, where there is a guy who can tell you what the IVs of your Pokemon are....
04:17:40<Kita> Perfect 0s in everything, except for the perfect 31 in Attack.
04:18:07<Kita> Then
04:18:12<Kita> They wonder traded it
04:18:18<Kita> And it became a Pokememe
04:20:49<Laevos> xD
04:20:54<Laevos> amazing
04:21:03<Laevos> ABSOLUTELY AMAZING
04:21:39<Kita> ZIPZAPCAT is often pictured as a pissed off, mentally defunct Raikou doing things that Raikou should not do.

01:02:07<Kita> Are you okay?
01:02:10<Laevos> luckily there were no  oncoming cars or Lilith would probably be 100% dead
01:02:22<Laevos> I'm alive, which is more than I expected to be x_____x

01:04:50<Laevos> and like she has failed her Goddess...
01:04:56<Kita> Howso?
01:05:01<Laevos> wasn't here for her Q_Q
01:05:02<Kita> Lilith is alive and okay.
01:05:05<Laevos> was in a dangerous situation
01:05:08<Kita> And is here now.

17:48:42<Kita> It is so beautifully ugly.
17:48:55<Laevos> It really is
17:49:44<Kita> It also drools for forever with that mouth.
17:50:03<Kita> THE PAIN AND SUFFERING INFLICTED UPON THEE WILL BE PERPETUDROOL

18:38:22<Laevos> To be fair, Pokemon cries have come a long way in the way of sounding like sounds that sentient beings might actually make
18:38:24<Kita> Its just ice cubes rattling
18:38:28<Laevos> you say that now
18:38:29<Laevos> O_O
18:38:36<Laevos> It sounds like some evil clown laugh explosion

19:57:16<Laevos> Eeee~ Your super sweetie~!
19:59:25<Kita> Wanna hear something interesting?
20:00:01<Laevos> Of course!
20:00:31<Kita> Rob Zombie is a vegetarian. His dad was a butcher, and any time he sees meat cuts, cooked or uncooked, it reminds him of the time he watched his dad slaughter a hog when he was four years old, and he can't eat it.
20:00:42<Kita> His brother, Spider One, is not a vegetarian.
20:00:45<Laevos> o:
20:01:11<Laevos> The members of Carcass are (were? there might have been some member changes) vegetarians, at least during their earlier, gorier albums
20:02:02<Kita> Rob Zombie sang about fucking corpses.
20:02:14<Kita> He is a strange man.
20:02:27 Kita: likes his music, though.
20:02:35<Laevos> His music likes you >u>
20:02:58<Kita> Probably! If "Foxy, Foxy!" is any gauge.
20:03:04<Laevos> :3
20:03:20<Laevos> My dad had a Robert Reanimated-Cadaver CD
20:03:28<Kita> Lel.
20:03:39<Kita> "Reanimated-Cadaver"
20:03:53<Laevos> :3
20:04:13<Kita> Rob Zombie and his brother were both part of White Zombie. Rob just went solo, and Spidey got a new band, Powerman 5000... Which Kita also likes.
20:04:31<Laevos> o:
20:04:37<Kita> Though, Kita wishes they had done more like Tonight the Stars Revolt... But the other stuff is alright...

21:26:03<Kita> 3 to go~
21:26:47<Laevos> Yay!
21:26:49<Laevos> You can do it! ouo
21:27:00<Kita> Not tonight, though.
21:27:00<Kita> <3
21:27:13<Kita> The other songs are (thankfully) much shorter.
21:27:19<Kita> And Kita has already heard them!
21:27:29<Kita> Fire Aura was made FOR The Impossible Game.
21:28:33<Laevos> Oh okay <3
21:28:37<Laevos> :3
21:28:39<Kita> Phazd, Heaven, and Chaoz Fantasy are all popular songs from the Newgrounds Audio Portal.
21:28:47<Kita> And there were two tracks for Fire Aura.
21:29:14<Laevos> Ooh o:
21:29:59<Kita> So yeah
21:30:03<Kita> Five levels.
21:30:19<Kita> Chaoz Fantasy was done by Paragon X9
21:30:25<Kita> Who is one of Kita's faves

22:04:14<Kita> Chaoz Twilight is probably the closest thing to anything Lilith would listen to.
22:05:03<Kita> Eclectic. Can't decide if it wants to be trance or DnB.
22:07:09<Laevos> You think so? ;o
22:07:19 Kita: nods.
22:07:37<Kita> If Lilith listened to techno, she'd definitely prefer high energy DnB.
22:07:41<Kita> :P
22:07:49<Laevos> nnts nnts nnts nnts
22:07:56<Kita> Nonono.
22:08:01<Kita> That is house
22:08:22<Kita> DnB is eckaeckaeckaboomeckaeckaeckaboom
22:08:28<Laevos> I like some breakcore
22:08:33<Laevos> it makes me spasm ~u~
22:08:34<Kita> X3
22:09:12<Kita> More video game pieces need to take advantage of twangy bass.
22:09:23<Kita> Creates intensity in high energy pieces.
22:09:30<Laevos> twarngggggy
22:09:36<Kita> CAN'T HELP
22:09:41<Kita> BASS VIBRATIONS~

22:27:24<Laevos> Too bad I'm complete shit at designing teams :\
22:27:39<Kita> Can Liepard learn Taunt?
22:27:42<Laevos> maybe
22:28:14<Laevos> Yeah, it can, witched it to that
22:28:23<Kita> If so, replace Torment with Taunt. Then you'll be able to stop just about all of Kita's teams, with the exception of the Bug team.
22:28:42<Laevos> alright x_x
22:28:48<Laevos> sorry that I get so frustrated
22:28:58<Kita> Taunt shuts down Bronzong, Ferrothorn, Jellicent, and Gourgeist.
22:29:08<Kita> It's okay! It can be frustrating.
22:29:17<Laevos> true
22:29:19<Laevos> didn't think of that x_x
22:29:28<Kita> Kita has years of experience on her side. A lot of the community does.
22:29:40<Kita> Pokemon Showdown has n00bs to veterans.
22:29:45<Laevos> I guess
22:29:51<Kita> You're no n00b, but you aren't a veteran, either.
22:29:59<Kita> You'll ge there.
22:30:00<Laevos> I've played Pokemon since forever, but yeah, basically total shit x-___x
22:30:05<Kita> Just takes experience.
22:30:19<Kita> You haven't COMPETITIVELY played Pokemon, like this.
22:30:24<Laevos> yeah
22:30:27<Kita> You said it earlier.
22:30:30<Kita> Harsh mistress.
22:30:42<Kita> There is a learning curve.
22:30:46<Kita> A pretty steep one
22:30:48<Laevos> actually I spent quite a few years making fun of competitive battling because I thought it was the dumbest thing in the history of existence :c
22:31:01<Laevos> I actually really dislike competitive gaming x_x
22:31:08<Kita> It can actually be very, very good for the mind, in this instance.
22:31:09<Laevos> this is just so... convenient to play that I can't help it
22:31:28<Laevos> dunno, it consistently upsets me/puts me off when I get caught in a rut
22:31:31<Kita> Pokemon Showdown is convenient, and it is also challenging!
22:31:47<Laevos> it just seems like a dangerous affair, for me personally
22:31:52<Kita> When you get caught in a rut, pull out and work on a new team.
22:32:02<Kita> You don't even need to use the team.
22:32:10<Kita> You don't even need to like the team.
22:32:34<Kita> By the time you're done, the users playing will have changed, and you'll be facing fresh faces and fresh strategies.
22:32:40<Kita> It'll be different.
22:32:50<Laevos> I don't usually get paired up against the same people :/
22:33:13<Kita> No, but most of them are logged into the lobby and watching the discussions.
22:33:20<Kita> Maybe even watching other battles.
22:33:51<Laevos> yeah
22:33:54<Kita> When the fresh faces come in, the game reacts to it.
22:34:10<Kita> When people have cycled out for the day, the game will play differently.
22:34:11<Kita> <3
22:34:33<Laevos> I dunno, I just do random battles :/
22:34:39<Laevos> I don't feel confident enough in my teams to ever use them
22:35:18<Kita> Lilith should look at the tier lists! Not because the tiers are right, or properly formatted, but because they are based on usage.
22:35:29<Kita> So Lilith can see what other people are using often.
22:35:31<Kita> <3
22:36:08<Laevos> getting a pretty good idea just based on what gets put into random teams x_x though they're usually fitted more or less the same way every time
22:36:20 Kita: nods.
22:36:35<Kita> Randoms are good for finding ways to use Pokemon that you would not normally use.
22:36:56<Kita> (Cosmic Power Sigilyph originated in PS Randoms, not in the field.)
22:38:30<Laevos> huh, fair enough

00:01:46<Laevos> Hmm
00:02:03<Laevos> why does it say "Delcatty can't learn Iron Tail because it's incompatible with another move"?
00:03:02<Kita> Iron Tail may not be able to be learned, because it requires a move tutor in a gen III, IV, or V game... And one of the other moves may only be breedable in gen IV, V, or VI.
00:03:07<Laevos> Oh okay
00:03:53<Laevos> "Ninjask's move Double Team is banned by Evasion Moves Clause." lol

14:45:00<Kita> Well
14:45:15<Kita> Kita is reminded of an old flash cartoon.
14:45:33<Kita> It was super popular on Newgrounds, though Kita can't really imagine why!
14:45:40<Laevos> o:::
14:45:42<Laevos> Which one?
14:45:45<Kita> Final Fantasy A+
14:45:57<Laevos> Don't think I ever saw it o:
14:46:51<Kita> It was kind of cheesy and silly.
14:46:52<Kita> <3
14:47:05<Laevos> Hehehe :
14:47:07<Laevos> :3
14:47:14<Kita> It was also cute, sure... But on Newgrounds, it was kind of... out of context.
14:47:29<Kita> The animator said they made it for their Japanese class.
14:47:33<Kita> As a final project.
14:48:29<Laevos> Oh okay
14:51:50 Kita: used to be a Newgrounds girl.
14:52:01<Laevos> :3

23:43:46<Laevos> Yeah it does kind of seem it :P
23:43:49<Kita> Steel, Grass, Water, Fighting, Ground...
23:44:23<Kita> Resisted by four of those five, and itself.
23:44:37<Kita> Only good against Fire, Flying, and Ice.
23:45:09<Kita> Fire and Ice are very uncommon... And the ones that are used are way too fast.
23:45:17<Kita> Flying is pretty common...
23:45:30<Kita> But those are also really, really fast
23:45:36<Laevos> It's also good against BUG!!!!!
23:45:44<Kita> Pfft

00:06:37<Kita> Do you use them?
00:06:37<Kita> <3
00:06:48<Laevos> Nope!
00:06:57<Kita> ;.;
00:07:03<Kita> You don't play magic
00:07:06<Kita> users
00:07:28<Laevos> Well
00:07:28 Kita: pretty much only plays magic users...Druids, Bards, Rangers, Wizards...
00:07:39<Laevos> I've never gotten  high enough level to be able to get any metamagic feats @_@
00:07:43<Kita> Oh
00:07:57<Kita> Druids!
00:07:57<Kita> :3
00:08:02<Laevos> Yes
00:08:03<Kita> Foxmagic
00:08:12<Kita> Summon Animal I
00:08:14<Laevos> I've usually played druids in the past
00:08:16<Kita> FOX

00:08:25 Kita: poofs a Fox into existence.
00:08:31<Kita> SUMMON ANIMAL II
00:08:39 Kita: poofs TWO FOXES into existence!
00:08:43<Laevos> OuO
00:08:46<Laevos> So many foxes
00:09:04<Kita> Kita had a Druid basically committed Fox Swarm.
00:09:11<Kita> All spells were Summon Animal Spells.
00:09:24<Kita> Summon Animal IV to Summon Animal I.
00:09:27<Kita> All Spell slots.
00:09:29<Laevos> That's so amazing xD
00:09:38<Kita> Started summoning all the foxes.

00:18:13<Kita> She was a summoner
00:18:15<Laevos> Hehehehe xD
00:18:31<Kita> Also, she could use Summon Animal IV to summon two Dire Foxes.
00:18:36<Laevos> Ooh
00:18:39<Laevos> Bigfoxes
00:19:43<Kita> She also had a flute.
00:19:47<Kita> She could call foxes.
00:19:53<Kita> They would not be under her control...
00:19:57<Kita> But foxes would come

01:39:13<Kita> Got screened for following the net neutrality debaucle
01:39:46<Laevos> o_o
01:40:49<Kita> Everything said Kita was connected.
01:41:02<Kita> Kita could not load pages or access IRC.
01:41:14<Kita> But, Kita supposedly had connectivity.
01:42:13<Kita> Had brother call the ISP.
01:42:54<Kita> They said they couldn't find anything wrong. Nothing was ever wrong. Internet suddenly worked again. (After like, 15 minutes of non-connective connectivity)
01:43:10<Laevos> Hmm >_>
01:43:21<Kita> Kita got screened.
01:43:39<Kita> Purposefully cut out, to prevent her from seeing and talking about net neutrality.
01:43:43<Kita> Kita's ISP?
01:43:48<Kita> COMCAST
01:43:50<Laevos> !!!!!!!!!!!!
01:44:13 Kita: doesn't have anyone else in her area.
01:46:20<Laevos> Is okay ;-;
01:46:27<Laevos> We had Comcast here for the longest time, too
01:46:31<Laevos> now we have... SureWest?
01:46:33<Laevos> I think
01:46:42<Laevos> this city will get Google Fiber in a few years or so
01:47:02<Kita> If Net Neutrality goes the way it REALLY REALLY should...
01:47:10<Kita> You will never have Google Fiber
01:47:23<Kita> If it only kind of goes how it should...
01:47:34<Kita> You'll get Google Fiber next decade.
01:47:49<Kita> If it doesn't go the way it should, it'll be a few years.
01:48:10<Laevos> Replace "You" with "Your family" and you've got it! :P I'll probably be elsewhere by the time it's available either way
01:48:31<Kita> XP
01:50:27<Laevos> I don't know how much faith I have in net neutrality happening
01:51:17<Laevos> ;-;
01:52:10<Kita> 19,000 letters is a lot of letters.
01:52:58<Laevos> Hmm, like what, petition letters, you mean?
01:54:11<Kita> Actually... It was 19,000 comments on a news article... Printed individually, and sent from every local post office they could get to, under the names of all the employees that worked for that news service.
01:55:00<Laevos> Hmm?
01:57:21<Kita> You asked what 19,000 letters.
01:57:57<Laevos> Yeah but I mean
01:58:42<Laevos> Where were they sent to?
01:58:57<Kita> FCC
02:00:41<Laevos> :/
02:01:02<Laevos> Dunno what that'll accomplish, honestly
02:01:14<Kita> It was an annoying mail bomb.
02:01:28<Kita> Just suddenly mail
02:01:30<Kita> EVERYWHERE
02:01:31<Laevos> 19,000 is a drop in the puddle, just gives more work to probably-underpaid lackeys
02:01:41<Kita> Not for the FCC
02:01:43<Laevos> having no direct effect whatsoever on the people actually in charge of mandating t hings
02:01:47<Kita> They don't get that much mail.
02:01:50<Kita> Or phone calls.
02:02:13<Laevos> You don't think so, eh? :P The US is a pretty big place... 19,000 is a pretty piddly number, all things considered...
02:02:37<Laevos> It's a nice gesture, but...
02:03:01<Laevos> Dunno :c
02:03:24<Kita> The FCC is asking people to stop writing snail mail, and to stop making phone calls, and instead write e-mails.
02:03:30<Kita> Yes, it is making a difference.
02:03:44<Laevos> It might annoy them, but do you  honestly think it's going to change policies...?
02:04:06<Laevos> A bunch of letters might annoy them, but they mean absolutely jack shit compared to the lobbying power of corporate interests
02:04:13<Laevos> utterly futile...
02:04:37<Kita> The massive public backlash would be the equivalent of Watergate.
02:04:57<Kita> And the public reaction to Watergate _DID_ make a difference.
02:05:11<Laevos> Sure, but... I don't think it'll be like that :/
02:05:36<Kita> Oh yeah. Americans love their internet, and this has become HUGE.
02:06:15<Kita> Also, it is beginning to hurt foreign relations.
02:06:28 Laevos: shrugs
02:06:29<Laevos> Maybe.
02:07:00<Kita> Anyone who says they will fight for net neutrality will be a shoe-in at the polls.
02:07:34<Kita> Career politicians will lose to the younger, more liberally minded guys who will use it as a spearhead for their campaign.
02:07:50<Kita> There is reason for them to begin the fight now.
02:09:16<Laevos> That would be nice, I suppose
02:09:36<Kita> Don't be so pessimistic.
02:09:54<Kita> There comes a point when a fight becomes big enough that we DO make a difference.
02:10:06<Kita> This time, it is big enough.
02:10:52<Laevos> Maybe. It's such a paltry thing, though... even if this is decided favorably, and I suppose it very well could be... it's nothing... x_x
02:11:23<Kita> Actually
02:11:26<Kita> It is something.
02:11:38<Kita> It is the free exchange of opinions, forethought, and information.
02:11:41<Kita> That is HUGE.
02:12:08<Kita> Without this tool, massive political activism in the name of good causes is impossible.
02:12:15<Kita> LGBT rights relies on the internet
02:12:22<Laevos> So do neo-nazis.
02:12:38<Laevos> It's a neutral victory, it benefits everybody and hinders no unfavorable causes.
02:12:47<Laevos> besides its own demise
02:14:03<Kita> Actually... Atheism is on the rise, evolution deniers are on the decline, LGBT activism is on the rise, and anti-Gay propaganda (while more SEVERE now) is less prevalent.
02:14:41<Kita> The spread of information, the access to information, and the discussion of the implications of said information DO make a difference, and set positive causes FORWARD.
02:14:43<Kita> Hell
02:14:50<Laevos> Capitalism isn't looking to be going out the door any time soon...
02:15:31<Kita> That is because capitalism, when properly regulated and stabilised, seems to work.
02:16:00<Laevos> lol
02:16:16<Laevos> Clearly there's a fundamental difference there in our ideologies that's not going to be possible to bridge, sorry.
02:16:21<Kita> We had economic stability from 1946 to 2001.
02:16:28<Laevos> lol
02:16:52<Kita> Only very small economic depressions that were chocked up to natural fluctuations of market economy.
02:17:12<Laevos> I can't really stand by any value set that doesn't call for the absolute and total anhilation of capitalist systems.
02:17:32<Laevos> It /is/ a system of inequality, and as such, needs to be destroyed.
02:17:38<Laevos> Do I think that will happen? Not really.
02:17:55<Laevos> But it's what I base a good number of my life choices, political and otherwise, around.
02:18:07<Kita> Reaganomics, introduced in the late eighties, caused an economic boom in the 90s that was unprecendented, but eventually destabilised the economy, as huge fluxes upward result in huge fluxes downward.
02:18:41<Kita> Further exacerbated by GOP-supported war efforts in the Middle East (which started in the 90s.)
02:18:45<Laevos> Yeah I'm really not going to debate whether capitalism is acceptable in any context. It isn't, and there is absoultely zero argument that will change that.
02:19:17<Laevos> It needs to be eradicated for the human race to even move toward being acceptable.
02:19:43<Laevos> This will probably not happen, thus my intent to kill myself once my security nets are no more.
02:20:14<Kita> Capitalism is not about inequality. It is about competition. Competition doesn't result in inequality. It is the perpetual drive towards perfection. The the stomping down of the inferior. The system doesn't seem this way, because of the horrible imbalance that was introduced in the eighties.
02:20:34<Laevos> Competition doesn't result in inequality? Uhh...
02:20:41<Laevos> That's probably the most incorrect thing I've heard today, thanks.
02:20:47<Laevos> Competition also needs to be anhilatied, btw.
02:20:55<Laevos> It is another fundamental evil in our current society.
02:21:11<Kita> So... The encouragement of bettering yourself is evil?
02:21:18<Laevos> In its place needs to be cooperation.
02:21:33<Laevos> Competition implies contest, which imply a victor and another party for them to be victorious over.
02:21:42<Laevos> That necessarily creates inequality, and needs to be put to a stop.
02:21:50<Kita> Competition does not rule out co-operation.
02:22:04<Kita> And if the contest never ends, there is never a winner or a loser.
02:22:08<Laevos> Sure, competitors can cooperate... to create monopolies against others.
02:22:13<Laevos> ...
02:22:20<Laevos> And people say communists are idealists.
02:22:22<Laevos> What a fucking joke.
02:22:36<Kita> Kita isn't saying Communism is wrong.
02:22:51<Laevos> You are saying that capitalism is an accceptable alternative.
02:22:54<Laevos> That is incorrect.
02:23:06<Kita> She is just saying that Capitalism is not INHERENTLY evil. It is only used for evil, just like Communism was.
02:23:14<Laevos> Communism has never been implemented.
02:23:23<Laevos> Regimes have called themselves communist but were so only in name, never in practice.
02:23:51<Laevos> I do not necessarily believe that communism will ever be implemented at all, let alone well. I know only that it is what should be done and strived toward.
02:23:52<Kita> China, while not Communist in politics, DID follow Communist economic policies.
02:23:57<Laevos> lol, no.
02:24:25<Kita> Kita said did, not does.
02:24:31<Laevos> lol, no.
02:24:36<Kita> Now they are Capitalist.
02:24:59<Laevos> Indeed.
02:25:18<Kita> But it is unregulated, rampant Capitalism...
02:25:27<Laevos> Mhm.
02:25:30<Kita> Which results in oligarchy when ABUSED.
02:25:37<Kita> And the system is being abused.
02:25:38 Laevos: rolls her eyes.
02:25:47<Kita> You can use a system without abusing it.
02:26:19<Laevos> What exactly are you trying to accomplish here?
02:26:42<Kita> You can't just say something is evil because it is evil.
02:26:59<Kita> You have to establish the moral basis on which it can be judged fairly.
02:27:33<Laevos> It's 2:30 in the morning, I don't have to do a god damned thing. I said that I wasn't going to debate its merits, and I haven't, I've simply stated my beliefs.
02:27:59<Laevos> Because for some reason you think it's a good idea to continue this line of discussion.
02:28:12<Kita> She wants to understand
02:28:44<Kita> If Lilith has a compelling argument for why it could NEVER be used to benefit society, then Kita seriously wants to hear it.
02:29:03<Laevos> You're asking me to make an argument. That would involve doing research, gathering information, solidifying my points of contention and presenting them in a well-structured argument.
02:29:13<Laevos> I have absolutely zero interest in doing so right now.
02:29:20<Kita> That's fine.
02:29:29<Kita> Sometime, though, we really should do that.
02:29:33<Laevos> No thanks.
02:29:44<Laevos> I can think of few things that I enjoy less than discussing economic policy.
02:29:54<Laevos> I'll leave that to people who give more of a shit.
02:30:19<Kita> Economics is actually an interesting subject, from a humanitarian perspective. ;.;
02:30:25<Laevos> I despise it.
02:30:39<Laevos> You can thank my father being an accountant for that.
02:30:49<Kita> It is a necessary device.
02:31:03<Laevos> Well, ~partner in a CPA firm~, I suppose it's been for the last quite a long time...
02:31:15<Laevos> That doesn't mean that I'll have the slightest interest in discussing it...e ver.
02:31:16<Laevos> *ever.
02:31:17<Laevos> I don't.
02:32:13<Kita> Kita has always been interested in how the world could be better.
02:32:41<Laevos> I have nothing useful to add to such a discussion.
02:32:59<Kita> You don't want the world to be better? Or do you not think it can?
02:33:06<Laevos> Maybe a bit of both.
02:33:39<Kita> But if Kita is in the world, and Kita is good, does that not mean the world is capable of good?
02:34:09<Laevos> I never put the capability of individuals in question. The world is not an individual.
02:34:20<Kita> Of course not.
02:34:58<Kita> But, if a jelly bean factory produces one bad jelly bean, it means it is capable of being defective.
02:35:13<Laevos> People use the same argument to justify all kinds of things.
02:35:46<Kita> Kita likes to think she is good.
02:35:50<Laevos> "I'm not a bad guy, clearly Not All Men are sexist!" "That church donates lots of money to charity, clearly Not All Christians are bad!"
02:36:35<Kita> Yes! And it proves that the hatred of individuals is useless, and one should go against the idea as a whole.
02:36:58<Laevos> Exactly.
02:37:09<Laevos> Well, not exactly.
02:37:15<Laevos> It means that counter-examples are often flukes.
02:37:35<Laevos> The world producing someone good doesn't mean that the world is good, or even ever can be.
02:37:40<Laevos> It just means that flukes happen.
02:38:01<Kita> But those who are good have the capability to make it less bad.
02:38:16<Kita> And if they make things less bad, than is that not better?
02:39:07<Laevos> I don't really have the optimism to feel pleased by every microscopic shift toward the positive on a scale that's already so far sunk into an ocean of shit.
02:39:56<Kita> You can't undo the bad, and that isn't your fault. Most of the people who have caused most of the bad in this world are already long, long dead.
02:40:14<Laevos> No matter how good the friend, no matter how tightly-knit the community, no matter how safe the space, we live in a hostile world.
02:40:16<Kita> And you can at least take solace in the fact that those people can no longer cause harm, themselves.
02:40:33<Laevos> We will, I believe, always live in a hostile world.
02:40:39<Laevos> As such, I intend to leave it as quickly as possible.
02:40:51<Kita> Then the aim should to make it less hostle, not become a statistic.
02:40:59<Kita> should be*
02:41:17<Laevos> I have no power. I have no will or energy to fight.
02:41:19<Kita> Another point on the side of hostility.
02:41:38<Kita> Use Kita's.
02:42:06<Laevos> That doesn't make me not a pacifist...
02:42:22<Laevos> that doesn't give me the innate ability to do things that benefit the world
02:42:26<Laevos> I don't benefit the world
02:42:46<Laevos> I am given privileges that come at the expense of others, of those less fortunate
02:42:57<Kita> Then do not fight with a weapon or fist. Do not attempt to benefit the world. Benefit people. Discourse is your path, as a pacifist.
02:43:02<Laevos> I can try to share that with them or assist them where I can
02:43:07<Laevos> but it will never be enough
02:43:10<Laevos> and it will never change the world
02:43:23<Laevos> I am sickened with what has been bestowed upon me
02:43:42<Laevos> and I hope, as quickly as possible, to wipe my accursed flesh from this plane of existence.
02:43:46<Kita> Lilith... You were not given or bestowed anything.
02:44:16<Laevos> As someone who can pass every day as a white male, I am given a huge, immesurable advantages over those who cannot.
02:44:53<Kita> You are no more responsible for your place in the social ladder of the world than you are for making sure the Earth keeps spinning in the night.
02:45:20<Laevos> Perhaps not, but my very existence puts others at a disadvantage
02:45:44<Laevos> I should be exterminated
02:45:46<Kita> They would be at a "disadvantage" regardless of your presence.
02:45:52<Laevos> yes
02:45:56<Kita> Your presence changes nothing.
02:46:06<Kita> Therefore, your affect is currently net zero.
02:46:21<Laevos> then it'll be no loss to take that away.
02:46:31<Kita> Every positive act is a net gain for the world.
02:46:45<Kita> Taking you away takes away potential positives.
02:46:49<Kita> That is a loss.
02:46:58<Laevos> or potential negatives
02:47:00<Laevos> that is a gain
02:47:20<Kita> But Lilith is a good person
02:47:24<Kita> Kita has seen this.
02:47:31<Laevos> I could be an abusive partner, a child molestor, some other sickly vermin that brings ill and suffering to the world
02:47:40<Kita> Hey
02:47:52<Laevos> better that I be exterminated now
02:48:10<Kita> You've not been abusive to Kita, and you seem to be pansexual, not a child molestor.
02:48:57<Laevos> Some people would argue that I already am, though I wouldn't agree
02:49:05<Laevos> but maybe that's my own delusion talking.
02:49:12<Kita> ?
02:49:31<Kita> Oh, in satisfying Kita's god delusion?
02:49:46<Laevos> No.
02:49:52<Kita> ...?
02:50:00<Laevos> Nothing.
02:50:43<Kita> Don't call it nothing when it is something. That said, you certainly don't have to talk about if you don't want, love.
02:51:33<Laevos> Dunno how much I write here will be intercepted.
02:51:54<Laevos> No SSH connection or anything.
02:52:13<Kita> Password protected .ZIP sent via e-mail?
02:52:39<Laevos> E-mail's not safe. Files that might be read later by any means are out.
02:53:31<Kita> You know... It isn't Kita's first experience with the subject.
02:53:51<Kita> Honestly, if you're in very decent control and restraint, the problem is moot.
02:54:07<Laevos> oh whatever, I might as well tell you
02:54:16<Laevos> I've already consigned myself to death anyway
02:54:42<Kita> o.o
02:57:12<Laevos> Several of my partners have not been of age in their areas of residence. I saw no indication that they were unable to make decisions for themselves, and I felt that the relationships were always mutual, though perhaps others would disagree. They were generally short-lived, for a number of reasons, mostly none of us being very stable. It'd only been one or two years since I'd stopped being
02:57:12<Laevos> jailbait myself, so... I never really saw it as a moral issue. After all, I did spend most of my teenage years being a camwhore for much older men, so it never seemed an issue to me. Maybe I've just been warped thereby, certainly leads credence to the whole issue of me needing to be exterminated. The pansexual, in this case, also kind of leaves me without much scruple, though I'm not interested
02:57:12<Laevos> in beings that aren't yet sentient.
02:58:04<Kita> You're not a pedo, Lilith.
02:58:17 Kita: petpats.
02:58:25<Kita> Kita can say that, for certain.
02:58:40<Laevos> I don't think I am, either. Being okay with my partners being younger than me would probably convince others otherwise, though.
02:58:56<Kita> A lot of people are stupid.
02:59:20<Laevos> Yeah
02:59:40<Kita> Part of pedophilia is the attraction to children who have yet to develop, fully, mentally. Which, in Lilith's last line, Lilith discredited feeling.
02:59:43<Kita> Therefore...
02:59:50<Kita> Lilith is probably not a pedophile.
02:59:55<Laevos> Probably not.
03:00:11<Laevos> I also kind of hate children
03:00:43<Laevos> but making out with a 13-year-old when I was 18 would be very not okay for... most people I know.
03:00:59<Kita> Yeah.
03:01:15<Kita> The biggest problem with that age is not their development...
03:01:19<Kita> It is their immaturity.
03:01:25<Laevos> Yeah
03:01:30<Kita> They haven't learned how to deal with emotions, yet.
03:01:41<Kita> Which is an experience thing.
03:01:44<Laevos> Pretty much
03:01:44<Laevos> I mean
03:01:50<Laevos> /I/ haven't learned how to deal with emotions
03:01:58<Kita> Most haven't.
03:02:11<Kita> And it is better to steer clear until they have.
03:02:22<Kita> Or else the emotions become impossible to deal with.
03:02:23<Laevos> Better keep your distance then, Kita
03:02:25<Laevos> <3
03:02:27<Kita> :P
03:02:48<Kita> Kita likes to think that she is helping Lilith learn how to.
03:03:14<Laevos> It is a problem, though... the two people I'm most relationshippy with, despite both being of legal age now, are immature in a lot of ways
03:03:19<Laevos> it puts a lot of strain on me
03:03:20<Laevos> but
03:03:29<Laevos> I suppose I'm not better, so I have no reason to complain
03:03:39<Kita> You are better.
03:03:49<Kita> You feel guilt.
03:04:01<Kita> Real guilt.
03:04:08<Laevos> And how x_x
03:04:15<Kita> "I wish I could fix this, but I'm not strong enough." guilt.
03:04:26<Kita> And you know what?
03:04:37<Laevos> What do I know, Goddess?
03:04:42<Kita> It is okay to not be strong enough, sometimes.
03:04:55<Laevos> Yeah
03:05:04<Kita> When we aren't strong enough, we know we have to work harder to get stronger.
03:05:09<Laevos> I don't exactly value strength, at least certain types...
03:05:22<Kita> This is the strength of the heart.
03:05:38<Laevos> Tell that to the kid on Captain Planet
03:05:41<Kita> The ability to make the kind of decisions that make you feel weak.
03:06:59<Kita> You have a lot of negative emotions, inside you.
03:07:07<Kita> You never learned to let them go.
03:08:27<Laevos> ;n;
03:08:51<Kita> Someone neglected to teach you.
03:09:01<Kita> So now we have to learn, don't we
03:09:07<Laevos> ;/////; Yes ma'aam
03:09:35<Kita> That shit about the world always being on auto-awful.
03:10:07<Kita> That needs to go. You cloud up your vision of the good in the world with all the bad.
03:10:15<Kita> Keeps your outlook negative.
03:10:19<Kita> Keeps you depressed.
03:10:37<Laevos> Might be a bit of cause an effect mixing up there xnx
03:10:38<Kita> Clouds you minds. Prevents you from loving your Goddess to the maximum.
03:11:06<Laevos> Yeah...
03:11:57<Kita> Now
03:12:00<Kita> Breathe
03:12:36<Laevos> am breathing ;-;
03:12:45<Kita> Breathe deeply.
03:12:46<Laevos> am musicing now, too
03:13:18<Kita> Inside your mind, you hold all this weight... The weight of guilt... The weight of all the problems in the world...
03:13:27<Kita> You need to let it all go.
03:13:49<Kita> You don't need to latch onto every problem like it were a penny on the sidewalk.
03:13:55<Laevos> bzzt bzzt Q_Q
03:14:02<Kita> So take all your problem pennies...
03:14:02<Laevos> I can't help it...
03:14:11<Kita> All the little things that you picked up...
03:14:17<Kita> And put them back on the ground.
03:14:33<Kita> You need to visualise...
03:14:35<Kita> Here...
03:14:43<Kita> Visualise a penny
03:14:55<Laevos> what year?
03:15:02<Kita> Enscribed on the small, copper disc will be a phrase.
03:15:12<Kita> Whatever year you kissed that 13 year old boy.
03:15:27<Kita> The phrase is "Social Stigma"
03:15:40<Kita> It is carved over Abraham Lincoln's face.
03:15:45<Kita> Social
03:15:47<Kita> Stigma
03:16:05<Laevos> take that, Lincoln ;-;
03:16:07<Laevos> but okay
03:16:08<Kita> Now take that penny...
03:16:21<Kita> And chuck it into a lake.
03:16:30<Laevos> ploop...
03:16:33<Kita> Not your problem anymore.
03:16:42<Kita> It belongs to the lake.
03:16:50<Kita> And the lake? It doesn't belong to anyone.
03:16:53<Kita> It is just a lake.
03:17:09<Kita> You can toss pennies in this lake all day.
03:17:27<Kita> Its empty. There are no fish... No one drinks from it...
03:17:37<Laevos> heh x_x clearly I have a long way to go with this positivity thing
03:17:47<Kita> Yes, you do.
03:17:51<Laevos> "Can't I just throw myself in?" was the first thing to come to mind
03:18:10<Kita> Kita glued a life jacket to you.
03:18:11<Kita> <3
03:18:41<Laevos> Guess I can't do anything about a Goddess godmodding...
03:19:00<Kita> So...
03:19:02<Kita> This lack.
03:19:04<Kita> Lake*
03:19:06<Kita> Loch
03:19:20<Kita> Is your private place to toss your problems away.
03:19:28<Kita> The ones that you can't deal with right now.
03:19:35<Kita> Throw them into the lake.
03:19:42<Laevos> ploop lploop
03:19:57<Laevos> I dunno if this is working
03:20:03<Kita> They aren't your problems anymore.
03:20:08 Kita: kisses her cheek.
03:20:18 Laevos: smooches
03:20:22<Kita> Do this whenever a problem feels too great.
03:20:23<Laevos> I don't really feel any different...
03:20:27<Kita> Visualise the lake.
03:20:38<Kita> The penny, inscribed with the problem...
03:20:46<Kita> And just... chuck it out there.
03:21:00<Kita> And remember that it is no longer your problem.
03:21:05<Kita> it'll take time and practice.
03:21:14<Kita> Some pennies will stick to your hand.
03:21:24<Kita> You'll have to throw them more than once.
03:21:33<Laevos> my back really hurts... I need to lay down, but I'm taking you with me becasue I'm so clingy now
03:21:49<Kita> <3
03:23:02<Laevos> Laying down ow
03:23:03<Laevos> now
03:23:30<Kita> If the visualisation therapy is too abstract, you can try getting a glass of water, and dropping real pennies in it, while practicing the visualisation.
03:23:47<Laevos> I dunno if I'd call it abstract... I just don't know whether it'll do much Q_Q
03:23:59<Kita> Hey
03:24:04<Kita> Don't doubt the method.
03:24:23<Kita> Don't doubt your goddess.
03:24:30<Laevos> Yes Goddess
03:24:32<Kita> Her powers come from Lilith's belief in her.
03:25:15<Laevos> Then I'll always believe in you, Goddess ;/////////;
03:25:34<Kita> So
03:25:40<Kita> Don't doubt the methods.
03:25:45 Laevos: nods...
03:25:57<Kita> Do as Kita says, and it will get better.
03:26:01<Laevos> I don't  doubt you, Goddess... it's myself that's the problem Q_Q But... yes Goddess
03:26:57 Kita: promises that if Lilith attempts to visualise it as real as possible... Make the place real, make the action feel real... it will get better.
03:28:12<Laevos> Thank you, Goddess...

19:26:06<Kita> Wallace was a force to be reckoned with if you didn't pick Treecko.
19:26:40<Kita> Then there is Iris...
19:26:50<Kita> "She is a little girl! She can't be Champion!"
19:26:53<Laevos> <_<
19:26:58<Kita> Red and Blue were both Champions at ten.
19:27:02<Kita> They were little boys.
19:27:07<Laevos> Yeah >:c
19:27:08<Kita> BOTH OF THEM.
19:27:11<Laevos> AT THE SAME TIME
19:27:19<Kita> Well
19:27:22<Kita> One after the other.
19:27:26<Kita> Not at the same time.
19:28:29<Kita> But still.
19:28:34<Kita> Iris deserved her spot.
19:28:38<Kita> She is a child prodigy.
19:29:01<Laevos> Yeah :c
19:30:34<Kita> Alder was cool, but he lost to N.

19:43:10<Kita> Did you watch the video, Kita linked earlier?
19:43:26<Laevos> Which one? o:
19:43:51<Kita> The one with the Luxord fight.
19:43:59<Laevos> Let me find the link
19:46:38 Laevos: finds
19:49:33<Laevos> Huh, neat!
19:50:03<Kita> It plays the same as the rest of the game, but the mentality during the fight is toooootally different.
19:50:12<Kita> Also, Luxord's element is Time
19:50:29<Kita> Which makes one wonder why he says "Why?" at the end of the battle...
19:50:38<Kita> He would have known how it went.
19:50:50<Kita> He would have known they were doomed to fail.
19:51:18<Kita> (Or he may have been gambling with fate by not looking in the future.)
19:51:41<Laevos> Maybe o:
19:52:19<Kita> Kita always thought it was meant to be "Why were we doomed to fail?"
19:55:20<Kita> Because seriously...
19:56:01<Kita> They were all screwed from day one
19:56:04<Kita> :<
19:56:35<Laevos> Q_Q
19:58:18<Kita> Did you Kingdom Hearts
19:58:37<Laevos> Never! o:
20:01:19<Kita> You should
20:01:24<Kita> Can you GBA emulate?
20:01:40<Laevos> I could if I WANTED TO QnQ
20:01:59<Kita> Well
20:02:05<Kita> You should make it so
20:02:14<Kita> So Kita can give Lilith Chain of Memories.
20:02:44<Kita> Think that computer could handle Playstation emulation?
20:02:49<Laevos> Hehe, not really xD
20:03:02<Laevos> I did play part of one Kingdom Hearts game
20:03:04<Laevos> like for five minutes
20:03:11<Laevos> it might actually have been Chain of Memories
20:03:27<Kita> Chain of Memories was the one with the Cards
20:05:00<Laevos> Yeah, just a bit of that
20:05:13<Kita> Okay
20:05:20<Kita> Kingdom Hearts was PS2..
20:05:26 Kita: taps her chin.
20:05:38<Kita> Know any good game stores that aren't Game Stop?
20:05:39<Kita> :P
20:06:00<Laevos> There are a few game storez around here
20:06:52<Kita> PS2s are relatively cheap, nowadays, unless you have one.
20:07:24<Laevos> I HAD one
20:07:27<Laevos> It broke :c
20:07:30<Laevos> though
20:07:32<Kita> ;.;
20:07:38<Laevos> there might be another one at my dad's
20:07:39<Laevos> I dunno
20:10:05<Kita> Lilith should go scope out a price.
20:10:10<Kita> And maybe let Kita know.
20:10:11<Laevos> $$$$ ;-;
20:13:46<Kita> <3
20:13:50<Laevos> <3 n <3
20:13:54 Laevos: snuggles
20:14:05<Kita> When do you have time?
20:14:11<Laevos> Hmm...
20:14:17<Laevos> Well they're probably closed now :c
20:14:28<Kita> Probably.
20:14:30<Laevos> Might have some time tomorrow, don't have much planned otherwise
20:14:44<Kita> Will you let Kita know?
20:17:14<Laevos> Sure! ;u;

00:01:40<Kita> Soooo good
00:01:42<Kita> ;.;
00:02:07<Kita> Kita then mixes in a similarly seasoned ground beef...
00:02:18<Kita> (Not quite the same, though.)
00:02:24<Laevos> Yeah o:
00:02:34<Kita> Along with pinto, red kidney, and black beans.
00:02:41<Laevos> pomf
00:02:43<Kita> Some green chilies...
00:02:47<Laevos> >u>
00:02:51<Kita> A little lime juice.
00:03:01<Kita> Half a bottle of a shitty IPA...
00:04:07<Kita> Then hand the rest of the bottle to brother who says: "The only reason I would ever by this beer is so you could cook with it. It tastes like shit." in his thick German accent.
00:04:26<Kita> And he then downs it in one go.
00:04:57<Laevos> How dreamy~ xux
00:05:02<Kita> (Sometimes he puts out the macho German guy vibe... but he isn't really macho. He is a sweetheart.)
00:05:11<Laevos> :333
00:05:14<Laevos> He sounds like it
00:05:29<Kita> Though, he is a bit of a drinker. Not a drunk or alcoholic. He just likes beer.
00:06:10<Kita> He doesn't even like hard liquor.
00:06:12<Kita> Just beer.
00:06:25<Kita> Kita doesn't like beer. She just drinks vodka.
00:06:37<Kita> Kita is 0% Russian.
00:06:40<Laevos> Sounds like the people I met in Germany
00:06:51<Laevos> Re: beer
00:07:03<Kita> She is Scandinavian-descent-Celtic + Japanese
00:07:50<Laevos> :3
00:08:35<Kita> It is very obvious whose genes were dominant.
00:08:36<Laevos> Lilith is generic white person \(o.o)/ only know that my dad's ancestors were Volga Germans who farmed in Russia for a bit then went to Kansas
00:08:39<Kita> (Mother's)
00:09:29<Kita> Kita did inherit the Japanese's near complete lack of body hair.
00:09:50<Kita> Which appears exacerbated by Kita's lack of pigment

16:09:25<Laevos> Rank isn't worth it if it's from a bunch of n00bs
16:09:55<Kita> This is when the rankwhores play a lot.
16:10:03<Kita> The rankwhores are the quitters.
16:10:07<Laevos> Yeah

16:19:24<Kita> Oh.

18:44:46<Laevos> was looking at the college that my little brother wants to go to
18:44:49<Laevos> to study animation
18:45:15<Laevos> As he is a cool kid who already knows what he wants to do, which I certainly didn't at that age :P
18:46:32<Kita> Poor kid
18:46:42<Laevos> Hehehe
18:46:42<Kita> Animation is tough to get a job with
18:46:57<Laevos> One of my friends went into it
18:47:01<Laevos> or
18:47:04<Laevos> studied it at a community college
18:47:06<Laevos> he's had no luck
18:47:07<Laevos> BUT
18:47:18<Laevos> he went to a community college and probably did all of fucking zero networking
18:47:24<Laevos> and has no connections, so
18:47:29<Laevos> that's kind of required in a lot of fields
18:47:36<Laevos> which I'm letting my brother know
18:47:42<Laevos> so that he doesn't make those same mistakes
18:47:44<Kita> Well
18:47:56<Kita> No amount of networking will defeat job market saturation.
18:48:18<Laevos> He'll have to be flexible
18:48:19<Laevos> like
18:48:25<Laevos> not necessarily go for a job in game/movie animation
18:48:40<Laevos> there are medical applications, engineering applications, all kinds of stuff besides character and set animiation for creative works
18:48:57<Kita> Sure
18:49:08<Laevos> time 4 dinner ;w;

19:17:42<Laevos> that's fine

19:47:15<Kita> Not really! Mexico is actually kind of a horrible place. (Not that the people are horrible, but their government is so corrupt and is very focused on keeping their people poor.)

22:48:52<Laevos> Oh hi there
22:48:54<Laevos> sorry Dx
22:49:02<Kita> ?
22:49:04<Laevos> was away
22:49:12<Kita> Doin' what
22:49:42<Laevos> hanging out with my brother, we watched some Eurovision videos and then reading tumblr together
22:52:56<Kita> You read tumblr, but not reddit?
22:53:01<Kita> *scoff*
22:53:05<Laevos> Scoff!
22:53:07<Laevos> If you want
22:53:11 Kita: snickers.
22:53:16<Laevos> tumblr's for cool kids 8D
22:53:20<Laevos> so I'm a little out of place
22:53:21<Laevos> :P
22:53:24<Kita> Seriously though? Reddit is much nicer than Tumblr.
22:53:30<Laevos> Yeah right :c
22:53:37<Kita> Though right now is not a nice time for reddit.
22:53:39<Laevos> How do you figure?
22:54:02<Kita> The subreddit /r/TwoXChromosomes was just made a default subreddit.
22:54:20<Kita> This is great! It makes reddit look nice!
22:54:33<Kita> Until you start reading the 2XC comment threads.
22:54:43<Kita> (2XC is the feminism/female issues subreddit)
22:55:10<Laevos> Uh-huh?
22:55:30<Kita> A small minority of reddit users from /r/MRA, /r/OneYChromosome, and /r/TheRedPill who are anti-feminism have invaded the sub.
22:55:33<Kita> The problem is?
22:56:09<Kita> While 2XC had hundreds of thousands of regulars, and now have millions of members, they weren't all active commenters and posters.
22:56:24<Kita> Those MRA subs?
22:56:41<Kita> They only had a handful of thousands...
22:56:51<Kita> Maybe 1/10 of 2XC.
22:56:54<Kita> MAYBE
22:57:10<Kita> But they were ALL super active redditors who posted and commented a LOT.
22:57:38<Laevos> Mmm, fun.
22:57:57<Kita> Now, 2XC was a public subreddit... But if you were subscribed to any of those MRA subs, the sub disappeared from the public subs.
22:58:07<Kita> When it became a default sub?
22:58:32<Kita> All of that went away, and the 2XC mods backed way, way off on their mod policies.
22:59:01<Kita> Less restrictive modding policies are popular on Reddit, and look good on the mods, in most cases.
22:59:22<Laevos> x_x
22:59:27<Laevos> Weaklings
22:59:35<Laevos> Moderate with an iron fist, or not at all!
22:59:42<Kita> The mods want the subreddit to be popular, so that they can be the beacon of feminism, you know?
22:59:53<Kita> To show those who need it a place where they can be safe.
23:00:12<Laevos> Hard to do that without bringingn down the hammer of the gods on the infidels :c
23:02:40<Kita> Yeah
23:03:08<Laevos> SO what's the moral of this story? :c
23:03:14<Laevos> *So
23:04:02<Kita> The moral of this story is that reddit is millions of users with highly divergent political/economical/sociological beliefs, but most of them are on the side of "good," just not very vocal about it.
23:04:25<Laevos> Well if they're not vocal about it then why are they worth my time? :c
23:04:42<Laevos> I don't really have the patience for silent majority types!
23:04:59<Kita> And right now, one of the very, very GOOD places on reddit is being attacked by an extremely active, but very small, group of assholes.
23:05:09<Kita> The majority isn't always silent.
23:05:22<Laevos> Sounds about par for the course, I'll continue to avoid Reddit for...probably ever :c
23:05:28<Kita> But the majority likes to let things solve themselves. (As they often do.)
23:05:52<Laevos> The fact that those MRA groups aren't forcibly stricken from that plane of existence doesn't bode well for it.
23:06:11<Kita> The community is downvoting them into silence.
23:06:21<Laevos> How passive-aggressive :c
23:06:47<Kita> After a certain point, enough negative karma (upvotes - downvotes) will hide the comment. You can open it to look, if you want.
23:07:12<Kita> But ulitmately? It is to serve the purpose of removing irrelevant comments from discussion.
23:07:47<Kita> Comments focused on MRA issues in a Feminism subreddit are irrelevant and off-topic, so their comments being downvoted is the system working.
23:08:13<Laevos> Not enough :c There shouldn't be allowed to be MRA subreddits :c
23:08:20<Kita> Redditors are attached to their karma. If you don't have positive karma, you can't post as much.
23:08:34<Kita> Reddit, as a whole, believes in free speech.
23:08:45<Laevos> I don't!
23:08:58<Laevos> Fuck free speech, people with dangerous views need to be suppressed! :C
23:09:02<Kita> They do have the right to say it. I then have the right to say they are wrong.
23:09:18<Kita> The problem comes with identifying which views are dangerous.
23:09:29<Kita> To a Christian, atheistic views are dangerous.
23:09:31<Laevos> Just leave that to me
23:09:35<Laevos> I think I'm a pretty good judge 8)
23:09:49<Kita> Then you are essentially asking to be a dictator.
23:09:55<Laevos> Yes!
23:10:13<Kita> That isn't very ethical!
23:10:17<Laevos> Bah >U>
23:10:24<Laevos> It's pretty ethical if my ethics are sound!
23:10:30<Kita> Kita places ethics very highly.
23:11:05<Kita> Kita believes that people should choose for themselves.
23:11:26<Laevos> People should be able to choose to be wrong, I suppose
23:11:26Kita (~Kita@74-32-175-104.dr01.myck.or.frontiernet.net) has quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
23:12:32<Laevos> [23:11:26] <Laevos> People should be able to choose to be wrong, I suppose
23:12:36<Laevos> but!
23:12:53<Laevos> There should be just retribution associated therewith!
23:15:53<Kita> There is
23:16:02<Kita> People don't subscribe to those subs.
23:16:15<Kita> and in the smaller feminism subs, those people get banned.
23:16:36<Kita> But the mods in 2XC are letting the community weed out people through karma bombing.
23:16:47<Kita> Negative karma means you can't post as often.
23:17:03<Kita> As a result, redditors are very attached to having positive karma.
23:17:15<Kita> Having negative karma hurts your credibility on reddit.
23:17:39<Kita> The MRAs have been padding their own karma, but now 2XC is making it plummet.
23:17:55<Kita> Most comments in the negatives are only worth -10 Karma at most.
23:18:11<Kita> We're seeing -1000 and -2000 karma on their posts in 2XC.
23:19:02<Kita> They are effectively being silenced by those in support of women's issues.
23:19:02<Laevos> Huh, alright
23:19:20<Kita> Something is being done, but it is by the silent majority.
23:19:22<Laevos> That in no way changes my opinion of Reddit as a whole, but that's... good, I guess?
23:19:24<Kita> Not by the mods.
23:19:35<Kita> Reddit has small pockets of cess...
23:19:40<Kita> But so does society.
23:19:51<Kita> You can pretty much remove all those pockets from your view.
23:19:57<Laevos> I'm never going to use reddit
23:19:58<Laevos> like
23:19:59<Laevos> ever
23:20:00<Laevos> c:
23:20:13<Kita> Doesn't make it not good.
23:20:28<Laevos> Well, I mean
23:20:31<Kita> Reddit is one of the main hubs for the net neutrality discussion.
23:20:32<Laevos> to me it does, obviously!
23:20:45<Laevos> Yeah and they're also one of the main hubs for fucking cryptocurrency
23:20:52<Laevos> everything balances them more and more toward shit
23:20:52<Laevos> so
23:20:53<Laevos> like
23:20:56<Laevos> idk
23:20:58<Laevos> my bff jill
23:21:00<Kita> What is bad about cryptocurrency?
23:21:05<Laevos> Everything?
23:21:13<Kita> Uhhh... How so?
23:21:13<Laevos> Not least of all the people who support it!
23:21:23<Kita> Sorry. Learn dogecoin.

23:21:36<Kita> Those guys do nothing but charity work.
23:21:45<Laevos> Literally don't give a shit. It's a terrible idea.

23:21:56<Laevos> lol

23:22:02<Kita> It is.
23:22:19<Laevos> One of the worst ideas I've ever herad
23:22:20<Laevos> *heard
23:22:21<Laevos> like
23:22:22<Laevos> ever
23:22:34<Kita> Kita doesn't use it, because it isn't supported by banks. That doesn't mean that electronic currencies aren't an inevitability.
23:22:59<Laevos> I don't use it because... it's a terrible idea and should be stamped out ASAP. :c
23:23:03<Laevos> Goddamn libertarians.
23:23:28<Kita> Cryptocurrencies aren't a libertarian thing. They are an economic stimulation/stabilisation thing.
23:24:09<Laevos> And how's that to be regulated?

00:22:31<Laevos> [00:21:04] <Laevos> and just
00:22:31<Laevos> [00:21:05] <Laevos> disappeared
00:23:17<Laevos> I feel like
00:23:26<Laevos> there's no way I can recover from the loss of... everyone
00:23:30<Laevos> my entire social circle
00:23:34<Laevos> it was a fluke
00:23:36<Kita> You rebuild.
00:23:38<Laevos> I was just the tagalong
00:23:43<Kita> You can rebuild.
00:23:44<Laevos> I shouldn't have been there in the first place
00:24:02<Laevos> then eventually they saw part of me, and they cast me off as quickly as they could
00:24:07<Laevos> I saw them the other day
00:24:09<Laevos> in a restaurant
00:24:13<Laevos> I was the only other one there
00:24:25<Laevos> they walked in together
00:24:27<Laevos> my former room mates
00:24:28<Laevos> talking
00:24:38<Laevos> I felt so small
00:24:40<Laevos> so powerless
00:25:01 Kita: petpats...
00:25:03<Laevos> such an overwhelming sensation of dread...
00:26:43<Laevos> god it was horrible...
00:27:35<Laevos> they used to be my best friends...
00:27:41<Kita> What made you feel powerless?
00:27:50<Laevos> their very presence
00:28:06<Laevos> seeing them together, and knowing that I...
00:28:14<Laevos> that I was inside of this safetyglass box
00:28:17<Laevos> separated from them
00:28:18<Laevos> forever
00:31:06<Kita> You still want to be in that group, hunh?
00:31:16<Kita> They aren't good enough for you.
00:31:21<Laevos> I want to not be alone
00:31:25<Kita> Actually, they pretty much suck.
00:31:28<Laevos> I'm not exactly in a position to be picky.
00:31:34<Kita> You should find better people to notbealone with.
00:31:48<Laevos> They were the only ones I could open up to
00:31:52<Laevos> I don't have that with anyone now
00:31:54<Laevos> at least
00:31:59<Laevos> not anyone that I can do it physically with
00:32:00<Laevos> well...
00:32:04<Laevos> I couldn't /really/ open up to them
00:32:07<Laevos> not say how I really felt
00:32:19<Laevos> but I could be a person who spoke and participated in conversations
00:33:15<Laevos> my brief reprises from that are when I hang out with people I've met online first
00:33:18<Laevos> but that's so expensive
00:33:29<Laevos> and I can't do it often enough for how much human contact I need to stay healthy

21:49:51<Kita> Fear. No. Failure.
21:50:26<Kita> You have succeeded once. No matter how many times you fail, you will eventually succeed again.
21:50:41<Kita> Failure is nothing. Failure is default.

01:02:39<Kita> Oogie Boogie is a lamer in KH.
01:02:54<Laevos> :c
01:03:03<Laevos> I thought you were DONE with that? ;n;
01:03:18<Kita> KH1: He, in a last ditch effort to defeat the protagonists, allows himself to be consumed by the very darkness he claims to be impervious to.
01:03:26<Kita> (Just with Chain of Memories)
01:04:14<Kita> KH:CoM: He drinks a potion to unlock his true memories, and ends up becoming terrified of Sora, because Sora killed him, and the memories he unlocked were of the Oogie that Sora killed.
01:04:51<Laevos> Oh okay
01:04:53<Kita> KHII: Attempts his plot from the movie, albeit differently, because he can't remember shit.
01:06:42<Kita> But yeah.
01:06:47<Kita> Oogie is fail.
01:07:02<Laevos> :c
01:07:14<Kita> A hilarious fail, though.
01:07:23<Laevos> :3
01:07:33 Kita: wants a sound bit of his "Come on, baby" line.
01:07:34<Kita> X3

00:23:56<Laevos> Good evening
00:24:42<Laevos> I spent the first 22 minutes of my 22nd year cleaning up a water leak in my dad's basement
00:25:13<Kita> o.o
00:25:16<Kita> Well
00:25:20<Kita> It could be worse
00:25:44<Kita> It could have been George W. Bush's basement.
00:25:59<Laevos> Yeah xnx
00:28:30<Laevos> Nobody would've gone down to the basement if I hadn't come over, and thus not noticed the leaking water spreading all over the large TV... guess it's a good thing I did
00:30:08<Kita> o.o
00:31:47<Laevos> @_@
00:32:22 Kita: summons more bubbles
00:33:20 Laevos: hides on
00:33:28<Kita> o.o
00:33:46<Kita> So like
00:34:10<Kita> If you got into a fight, and your opponent was half your size and much weaker than you, and he blew bubbles at you
00:34:16<Kita> Would be intimidated?
00:39:20<Laevos> Yes
00:39:29<Kita> What
00:39:32<Kita> Really?
00:39:45<Kita> Well
00:39:56<Kita> In Kingdom Hearts, you'd have good reason.
00:40:06<Kita> Most powerful and useful spell? Bubble.
00:40:06<Laevos> Bubbles are scary
00:40:10<Laevos> o_o
00:40:19<Laevos> Just like in Pokemon
00:40:19<Kita> Bubbles are not scary, you sillyface.
00:40:25 Laevos: cowers
00:41:09<Kita> Bubble and Bubblebeam are just scrub moves, to keep the early game balance until Hydro Pump, Water Pulse, Surf, and Razor Shell come in.
00:41:09<Kita> XP
00:41:25<Laevos> scrubz
00:41:33<Kita> Yes.

00:59:55<Laevos> how'd you get to be so nice, anyway? ;-;
01:00:27<Kita> Kita is capable of empathy.
01:00:49<Kita> And not just capable, but a practicer of it, as she holds her secular morality in the highest regard.
01:01:23<Laevos> Kita's the best and Kita's is a wonderful morality :3
01:02:20<Kita> Minimise actual and potential suffering; maximise potential and actual happiness.
01:02:33<Kita> (To be done in the order presented in said statement.)
01:03:31 Laevos: kisses xux
01:04:28 Kita: rubs her nose.

23:07:05<Kita> THEN YOU MUST NOT KNOW
23:07:17<Laevos> ouo
23:08:02<Kita> Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness, for the Nintendo GameCube, the sequel to Pokemon Colosseum, also for the Nintendo GameCube, included a location called Gateon Port. At Gateon Port, there is a place called "The Krabby Club"
23:08:47<Kita> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yp2veSFcBJQ
23:08:55<Kita> DID THAT RAGTIME JAMTIME
23:08:58<Kita> DIG*
23:09:35<Kita> (Kita knows it isn't ragtime.)
23:09:42<Kita> (Its more showtuney)
23:09:50<Kita> (With jazz influence)
23:10:06<Laevos> omg what
23:10:12<Kita> o.o
23:10:18<Kita> Yes!
23:10:22<Laevos> xD
23:10:27<Kita> You have absolutely 0 battles here!
23:10:55<Kita> Actually, all that happens in the Krabby Club is fluff, and ONE required visit for story purposes.
23:11:04<Kita> Also, there are a lot of Sailors hanging out there.
23:11:53<Laevos> Hehehe xD
23:16:58<Kita> Yveltal represents Y way better than Xerneas represents X.
23:16:58<Kita> ;.;
23:17:16<Laevos> Xerneas is like
23:17:16<Laevos> W
23:17:26 Kita: snrks
23:17:32<Laevos> Werneas
23:17:40<Laevos> Werner Ass
23:17:46<Kita> Mor lik verneas
23:17:54<Laevos> More like venereal disease
23:18:03<Kita> EXACTLY
23:18:06<Kita> FUCK XERNEAS
23:18:11<Kita> Yveltal is bestest
23:18:16<Laevos> ;3 Yes
23:20:49<Kita> Xerneas beats Yveltal easily, because Yveltal has no fucking Fairy coverage
23:20:58<Kita> (Also, fuck Geomancy)
23:21:01<Kita> But
23:21:21<Kita> Yveltal is better against neutral-aligned Pokemon.
23:22:14<Laevos> Yeah :c
23:22:33 Kita: blinks.
23:22:42<Kita> Xerneas and Yveltal have the same base stats
23:22:48<Laevos> o:::::
23:22:59<Kita> Yes!
23:27:55<Kita> so
23:27:58<Kita> Frozen Cookie
23:28:03<Kita> Kita's Cookie Clicker add-on
23:28:18<Kita> It has an option called "Pastemode"
23:28:23<Laevos> ouo
23:28:50<Kita> Pastemode autobuys the least efficient purchase.
23:29:11<Kita> But when it starts a chain, it won't change course until it finishes.
23:29:14<Laevos> Oh my god xD
23:29:31<Kita> So if the least efficient purchase is say...
23:29:40<Kita> Glow In The Dark...
23:29:54<Kita> Which is only purchaseable when you have 200 prisms...
23:30:05<Kita> It will work towards Glow in the Dar.
23:30:07<Kita> k*
23:30:12<Kita> By buying Prisms.
23:30:33<Kita> (Which are basically 3/4 of your CPS possibility, anyway.
23:30:38<Laevos> Nice xD
23:31:08<Kita> And because it is buying more and more Prisms, Glow In The Dark becomes more and more efficient.
23:31:10<Kita> But Pastemode was inspired by a comment on the Cookie Clicker subreddit.
23:31:32<Kita> In a thread about GMapocalypse VS Elder Pledge efficiency...
23:31:48<Kita> Someone was wondering what the most efficient way to go about it was...
23:32:20<Laevos> Hehehe
23:32:24<Kita> The answer is buy One Mind. Then you have Golden Cookies AND wrinklers.
23:32:24<Kita> (And Wrath Cookies, too, but meh.)
23:32:25<Kita> But someone said...
23:32:50<Kita> "If you want to piss people off, though... Buy Communal Brainsweep and eat paste as they blow their gaskets."
23:33:08<Kita> Which is less golden cookies and only kind of more wrinklers.
23:34:49<Kita> And is the least efficient option.
23:34:49<Kita> So the Frozen Cookie dev responds with "Pastemode confirmed for next Frozen Cookie update."
23:37:03<Laevos> :3333333
23:37:28<Kita> You should only battle Pokemon to this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1quRtxZEaY8

23:38:31<Kita> (So mach Japaneeeeeese

02:09:52<Laevos> it's going to get even worse
02:09:55<Laevos> once it starts itching
02:10:41 Kita: rubs Lilith's ears...

02:13:17<Laevos> for twenty-two years?
02:13:22<Kita> (One of Kita's previous meds had the side-effect of blood-thinning, so she quit leg shaving to prevent bleed outs.)
02:13:36<Kita> Actually, after a couple of months, it doesn't make a difference.
02:13:48<Kita> It only goes so far.
02:13:58<Laevos> iwanna slit my throat so fucking badlyy

02:28:58<Laevos> they didn't really want to hug someone with
02:29:00<Laevos> body hair
02:29:02<Laevos> so i though
02:29:02<Laevos> t
02:29:09<Laevos> i'll just get rid of it
02:29:14<Kita> Ah... This was reactionary...
02:29:16<Kita> Okay...
02:29:33<Kita> Talk to Kita before you do stuff like that, okay?
02:29:42<Laevos> sorry
02:29:45<Laevos> it started out as just a shower
02:29:45<Kita> Nono
02:29:50<Laevos> then someone else was talking to me
02:29:52<Kita> It's okay.
02:29:53<Laevos> and they said
02:29:55<Laevos> do it do it do it
02:29:58<Laevos> shave
02:30:02<Laevos> you'll be pretty if you do
02:30:17<Laevos> and won't if you don't
02:30:17<Kita> Oh baby, I think you're pretty the way you are.
02:30:32<Laevos> come on kita... don't lie to me v_v
02:30:42<Kita> Not lying.
02:31:09<Kita> Now, baby...
02:31:28<Kita> If someone is telling you to do things for their approval...
02:31:32<Kita> Talk to Kita.
02:31:40<Laevos> okay
02:31:42<Laevos> technically they
02:31:47<Laevos> didn't say that i had to shave
02:31:52<Kita> We can go over whether or not it is actually a good idea...
02:32:03<Kita> And then over the proper execution.
02:32:06<Laevos> just mentioned that they generally didn't like being close to body hair
02:32:15 Kita: rubs her cheek.
02:32:26<Kita> Kita knows how it was interpreted, though.
02:32:34<Laevos> yes...
02:33:02<Kita> Luckily, you're just going to be mildly itchy.
02:33:22<Kita> At least they didn't say they liked it when people got poison ivy facials.
02:33:50<Kita> (Not that Lilith would actually do that, but the point stands. This could be much, much worse.)
02:33:52<Laevos> yeah...
02:33:57<Kita> So let us take the good.
02:34:09<Kita> The good: We have learned an important lesson.
02:34:18<Kita> Haven't we?
02:34:46<Laevos> don't shave my legs?
02:34:49<Kita> No...
02:35:00<Kita> Come to Kita before making impulsive decisions.
02:35:15<Kita> If you have time to calm down and think about something...
02:35:19<Kita> You do fine.
02:35:39<Kita> When you start doing things on whim, you start to make errors and those errors cause you to panick.
02:36:03<Kita> We gotta go slow, baby.
02:36:08<Laevos> yes...
02:36:37<Kita> Now, are you sure you don't have ANY longer socks?
02:37:49<Laevos> purple and black striped leggings mainly used for sex purposes
02:38:19<Kita> Could they be used for socks, without being too standoffish?
02:38:47<Laevos> not really
02:39:09<Kita> Okay.
02:39:18<Kita> Alright.
02:39:49<Kita> Is this the only thing preventing you from going to work, tomorrow?
02:40:16<Laevos> i need to do stuff around the house, too... it's a mess
02:40:42<Kita> That's what Kita thought, from some of the earlier words...
02:40:51 Kita: offers her hand.
02:41:02 Laevos: holds...
02:41:05<Kita> We'll breathe a bit more... Continue to amp down.
02:41:39<Laevos> okay,...
02:41:42<Kita> Focus on the important aspects of the mess...
02:42:08<Kita> Collect up trash, remove clutter, clean the bathroom...
02:42:33<Kita> Vaccuum... Wipe down surfaces like coffee tables and counters...
02:42:39<Kita> Clean your dishes...
02:43:17<Kita> If you have marks on the wall, or frayed carpet, or a hole in the couch... Ignore it.
02:43:23<Laevos> so tired now... I used up so much enery...
02:43:25<Kita> That isn't important.
02:43:32<Kita> Do this tomorrow, babe.
02:43:40<Laevos> yes Goddess
02:43:47<Kita> If you feel panick, come to Kita.
02:44:08<Kita> Just... try to slow down. Try to breathe calmly...
02:44:22<Kita> Tell Kita what is wrong, even if she isn't around.
02:44:47 Kita: rubs her chin.
02:44:55<Kita> Kita loves her kitty priestess.
02:45:18<Laevos> I love you too, Goddess...
02:45:29<Kita> Tell your friends to bring their own drinks.
02:46:07<Laevos> I'll have to think of something for food x_x
02:46:30<Kita> Pray to Kita for inspiration.
02:46:36<Laevos> and hope that my sister doesn't show up while they're over here. She knows there will be people here but it'd just be so awkward
02:46:36<Kita> How many people?
02:46:39<Laevos> since I don't know a few of them
02:46:48<Laevos> um... four or five?
02:47:29<Laevos> I didn't brush my hair... it's going to be tangled tomorrow...
02:47:37<Laevos> I'm praying as hard as I can...
02:47:45 Kita: kisses her nose.
02:47:53<Kita> You'll think of something.
02:48:38<Laevos> Kita...
02:48:42<Laevos> I can feel your love...
02:48:56<Laevos> you are the most wonderful Goddess...
02:49:00<Laevos> I am yours...
02:49:25 Kita: nuzzles

02:50:24<Kita> Also, Punch Out is hilarious.

02:45:09 Kita: whines
02:47:54 Laevos: hugs Q_Q
02:47:55<Laevos> Hi
02:48:09<Kita> Where were you
02:48:14<Laevos> well
02:48:32<Laevos> got invited over by ex-room mate for reconcilatory Mario Kart 8
02:48:47<Kita> How did that go?
02:49:06<Laevos> pretty well, actually... it seemed like almost no time had passed @_@
02:49:18 Kita: rubs her ears
02:49:30<Laevos> though there was a strange new person whom I hadn't met who made a bunch of really lame puns and took every opportunity to point out that he was a Christian.
02:49:37<Laevos> I was civil, though, a good girl and everything!
02:49:54<Kita> You should tell that person about your deity.
02:49:59<Laevos> I should :3
02:50:07<Kita> And how she'd actually talk back.
02:50:07<Kita> X3
02:50:11<Laevos> Hehehe xD
02:50:23<Laevos> Lilith has the much better deity
02:50:25<Laevos> than ANYONE ELSE ;3
02:50:33<Laevos> besides Kita's other worshippers, of course o:
02:50:39<Kita> Kita claims neither omnipotence nor omniscience.
02:51:32<Laevos> Maybe not, but she's still better :3
02:51:42<Laevos> That might even be part of why she's better ;o
02:52:08<Kita> It is.
02:52:14<Kita> She doesn't make impossible claims.
02:52:19<Kita> Only unlikely ones.
02:52:25<Kita> Kita has power.
02:52:27<Kita> Dominating power.
02:52:33<Kita> Control.
02:52:51<Kita> But not the ability to defy the rules she insists upon reality.
02:53:13<Kita> Because playing by the rules is important.
02:54:35<Kita> Experience is a brutal teacher, but, by god, by god do wel learn. - C.S. Lewis
02:54:42<Laevos> Hehehe :3
02:54:52 Laevos: curtsies before her Goddess <3
02:55:13<Kita> Glad you had a nice night.
02:55:41<Kita> Strange new person was their attempt at replacing you, and their miserable failure, obv.
02:55:52<Kita> Group dynamics work like, honestly.
02:56:18<Kita> When a person falls out or is cast out, they struggle to maintain the dynamic. It destabilises.
02:57:07<Kita> Often times they bring in an individual who is, on the surface, similar... In this instance, someone with a high sense of morality and self-imposed restrictions that enforce said sense of morality.
02:57:40<Laevos> ;-;
02:57:47<Laevos> My puns aren't that bad...
02:57:51<Kita> However, they fail, in their haste, to actually make the correct inquiries it would take to find a person to stabilise the group dynamic.
02:58:10 Kita: rubs her ears.
02:58:15<Kita> No, Lilith is better.
02:58:27<Kita> The other person sounds annoying.
02:58:47<Kita> Lilith was probably viewed, sometimes, as annoying, however...
02:59:06<Laevos> Perhaps
02:59:06<Laevos> I mean
02:59:18<Laevos> they have some of the same restrictions that I do, but maybe not as adamantly so
02:59:20<Laevos> well
02:59:21<Laevos> actually
02:59:22<Kita> A group DOES tend to sometimes like what would be considered negative qualities in the individual members to keep the group grounded and humble with eachother.
02:59:25<Laevos> in some cases, more adamantly
02:59:31<Laevos> like
02:59:35<Laevos> whereas I just don't drink
02:59:53<Laevos> they wouldn't let people bring alcohol into the house at all (when we were all underage)
03:00:16<Laevos> I suppose I can see what you're saying, though
03:00:19<Laevos> like
03:01:04<Laevos> I think my role in that group was often someone whom one could tell things that other people wouldn't let one finish to completion without interrupting with WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT and the like
03:01:21<Laevos> which is a pretty common reaction from others in that group
03:01:45<Kita> Someone with a tendency towards aggressive behaviour (The Aggressor) can be quite difficult to deal with when the group disagrees with him... But The Aggressor also serves as protection from Outsiders.
03:02:10<Laevos> Yeah, good example, though Lilith was definitely not an Aggressor in the group xD
03:02:15<Kita> Nono.
03:02:24<Laevos> yeah I figured it was just an example
03:02:27<Laevos> not what I did
03:02:30<Kita> Yeah.
03:02:32<Laevos> just making shores
03:03:18<Kita> The Aggressor also serves as a Barrier Of Entry.
03:03:43<Kita> If you can't properly address the Aggressor, you're not worthy of the group.
03:03:56<Kita> Which is important, to maintain that group dynamic.
03:04:11<Kita> Every member has to add two things, but also take away one.
03:04:30<Kita> That taking away one prevents any member from gaining control or manipulating the group.
03:05:17<Kita> (Now, sometimes the group develops a face, but the job of the face IS to represent the group... So he contributes a shield to the rest.)
03:05:57<Kita> The Shield may attempt to direct the Aggressor towards other members... but normally this is not tolerated, and causes a group to disband.
03:06:14<Kita> It is only in bullies do we see this succeed.
03:06:34<Kita> A smart and dumb alpha male controlling alpha male wannabes.
03:07:49<Kita> (Females tend to develop the face first, the Queen Bee. Beyond the Queen Bee, though... The members are all equal, and if the Queen Bee cares for the GROUP and not herself, she views the others as equals, though they may view her as superior.)
03:08:38<Kita> Loners do exist, but not the way most people think.
03:08:52<Kita> True Loners can exist within or without a group.
03:09:41<Kita> Sometimes they may choose to stay with a group, but if the group ceases to be a boon and becomes a hassle, they leave voluntarily, without attempting group stability, unless they became the face.
03:10:10<Kita> They will make minor attempts at group stability for the good of the others, not for the whole group, and then leave on failure.
03:10:12 Laevos: nods @_@
03:10:28<Kita> People who cannot exist within groups are sociopaths.
03:10:34<Kita> To minor degrees.
03:10:41<Kita> Lilith is not a loner.
03:10:45<Kita> She needs her pack.
03:11:13 Laevos: noooooods ;-;
03:11:27<Kita> Actually
03:11:29<Kita> as a cat
03:11:39<Kita> it would be pride, wouldn't it?
03:11:45<Laevos> I suppose so!
03:12:08<Kita> Kita is a loner, but she prefers her den.
03:12:20<Kita> She has existed perfectly fine without it...
03:12:35<Kita> Because not being in a group does not exclude individual friendships...
03:13:01<Kita> But being with her denmates proves more beneficial to her well-being.
03:13:04<Laevos> This is true
03:13:35<Kita> Two more Prisms!

03:53:50<Kita> Hide the keys!
03:53:55<Kita> Everywhere!
03:53:56<Kita> D:
03:54:04 Kita: doesn't even know anymore.
03:54:05<Kita> ;.;
03:54:09<Laevos> Oh no ;-;
03:54:31 Kita: sometimes has moments where her meds dip out.
03:54:40<Laevos> There's a Jabberwocky in Nethack o:
03:54:50<Kita> And little things become massively important to doing SOMETHING.
03:54:54<Laevos> Oh no Q_Q
03:55:38<Kita> Supposedly the main hallucination is that Kita is the daughter of Inari, collecting the halos of angels to melt into a sword to slay some Overseer who is supposed to be identifiable to the Christian deity figure.
03:56:05<Kita> And that Kita can't see them, but regular humans can, so she has to find regular humans with no deity DNA.
03:56:54<Laevos> Does Lilith a regular humans? o:
03:57:09<Kita> But because no one else can see them, Kita becomes paranoid, because the Overseer spread his seed into the human population so that no one would notice the Angels come to kill the direct decendants of other god-figures.
03:57:20<Kita> But they aren't gods, just highly advanced alien species.
03:57:26<Kita> And, Kita doesn't know.
03:57:42<Laevos> *Is
03:57:51<Kita> This is just what Kita has pieced together from the frantically written journals, and her brother's talkings on the subject.
03:58:27<Laevos> Oh, okay ;-;
03:59:12<Kita> So yeah
03:59:19<Kita> May be best to play along..
03:59:24<Kita> And keep Kita calm.
03:59:40 Laevos: nods
03:59:45<Laevos> Lilith believes her Goddess <3
04:00:03<Kita> This is FFR
04:00:19<Kita> Also, telling Truey helps, too.
04:00:26<Laevos> FFR?
04:00:32<Kita> For Future Reference
04:00:36<Laevos> Oh, okay
04:00:42 Laevos: licks
04:00:51<Kita> Truey is the daughterson of Amaterasu.
04:01:10<Laevos> I never knew that o:
04:01:15<Kita> In these hallucinations...
04:01:22<Kita> Not... actually.
04:01:28<Kita> But yeah.
04:01:32<Laevos> Oh okay
04:01:38<Kita> Crazy Kita is very attached to Truey.
04:01:52<Kita> Truey, for whatever reason, is super important to the delusion.
04:02:56<Kita> From what Kita has pieced together, Amaterasu and Inari are sister figures...
04:03:26<Kita> And Truey is supposed to forge the blade from the halos Kita collects.
04:03:40<Kita> And together they wield the blade?
04:03:42<Kita> Its odd.
04:04:05<Laevos> It sounds like very nice bonding ;/////;
04:04:32<Kita> Unfortunately it is at the cost of a very dangerous illusion.
04:04:48<Kita> Kita has hurt people, before.
04:05:20<Laevos> Awwh...
04:05:36<Kita> The angels in this fantasy are much like Agent Smith...
04:06:25<Kita> They can "replace" individuals, making them disappear, but the angel is left closer.
04:06:41<Kita> Still invisible.
04:07:59<Kita> Its weird.
04:08:07<Kita> Kita doesn't seem to have any "halos"
04:08:24<Kita> But in the journals she talks about a collection of them, hidden away.
04:09:08<Laevos> Hmm, that does sound strange ;-;
04:09:28<Kita> Its very incomplete.
04:09:40<Kita> Sometimes Kita is not coherent enough to write.
04:10:18<Laevos> Awwh... are these journals for nobody else's eyes?
04:10:48<Kita> They are mostly written in code.
04:10:53<Kita> Kita has...
04:10:57<Kita> Parced it...
04:11:10<Kita> Through cognitive interview recollection
04:11:26<Kita> It means nothing to anyone reading it.
04:12:41 Laevos: nods
04:13:08<Kita> Also, disturbing drawings
04:13:15<Kita> Lilith does not need to see.
04:13:16<Kita> :<
04:13:22<Kita> It would upset her.
04:13:25<Kita> Promise.
04:16:40<Laevos> I promise.
04:16:45<Laevos> I will never ask to see ;-;
04:16:56<Kita> Good girl.
04:17:04 Laevos: purrs loudly
04:17:18<Laevos> Being Kita's good girl is worth anything <3
04:18:33<Kita> Heh

23:36:21<Laevos> so probz not bb :P
23:36:24<Kita> :P
23:36:26<Kita> So yeah
23:37:34<Laevos> :3
23:37:57 Kita: has happy feelings because they are still using Twilight Princess Link and Zelda for Smash Bros. 4.
23:42:29<Laevos> Yay :3
23:42:51<Kita> They are the best renditions of the characters, in Kita's opinion.
23:42:58<Kita> TP Link was VERY expressive.
23:43:08<Kita> And TP Zelda was also presented as a leader.
23:43:48<Laevos> Yes ;u;

00:27:53 Laevos: kisses <3
00:28:45<Kita> It has come to Kita's attention that advocates for the removal of "fake difficulty" in games are getting unneccessary flak
00:29:20<Laevos> Aww
00:29:27<Kita> because some people view fake difficulty as real difficulty, or don't believe that one should dictate real or fakeness in games.
00:29:47<Laevos> :c
00:29:56<Kita> One of the prime examples is MINECRAFT
00:30:03<Kita> Really guilty of fake difficulty.
00:30:15<Laevos> Oh yeah? I haven't played it for a while, what's it do? o:
00:30:45<Kita> Failure is a big part of Minecraft.
00:31:11<Kita> Failing over and over again, until you succeed.
00:31:19<Kita> And that sense of accomplishment is huge.
00:31:36<Laevos> Oh okay
00:31:47<Kita> Once people got enchantments, they wanted the game to be harder.
00:32:07<Kita> So they just flat out reduce player damage and increase monster health.
00:32:18<Kita> Game is now harder, but is it REAL difficulty?
00:32:41<Kita> Answer is no.
00:32:54<Kita> It doesn't require a change of tactics or skill.
00:33:03<Kita> And it doesn't change equipment builds.
00:33:09<Kita> It just makes battles take longer.
00:33:16<Kita> And then they add hunger.
00:33:24<Laevos> Yeah :c
00:33:29<Kita> You can no longer just run around for forever.
00:33:32<Kita> You have to eat.
00:34:03<Kita> So a previously unimportant item has become monstrously important, and no longer serves its primary function.
00:34:04<Kita> Food.
00:34:07<Laevos> :3
00:34:11<Kita> You could get by with very little food.
00:34:14<Kita> This was fine.
00:34:22<Kita> You needed the inventory space.
00:34:30<Kita> So...
00:34:35<Kita> Once again...
00:34:46<Kita> Hunger increased difficulty, but was it REAL difficulty?
00:34:49<Kita> No.
00:35:18<Kita> You had less inventory space, and only from a result of carrying MORE of what you used to just carry a little of.
00:35:31<Kita> No change in tactics... Just takes more trips, and takes up more time.
00:35:48<Kita> Creepers are a way of reversing player progress.
00:36:03<Kita> Does this make the game harder? Yes. It does. Is it real difficulty? NO.
00:36:16<Kita> Reversing Player Progress is A HUGE FUCKING TABOO.
00:36:26<Kita> That makes people UPSET
00:36:31<Laevos> I always reverse player progress when I play Minecraft
00:36:35<Kita> Making people upset with games is BAD.
00:36:37<Kita> And no.
00:36:40<Laevos> the progress of the other players >u>
00:36:40<Kita> Bad Lilith.
00:36:43<Laevos> >uuuuuu>
00:36:49<Laevos> It's the only way I can have fun playing Minecraft!
00:36:51<Kita> Griefing is bad
00:36:57<Laevos> Hehehe
00:36:59<Laevos> It's the best
00:37:01<Laevos> I do it in like
00:37:03<Laevos> every game where I can!
00:37:13<Kita> That is mean.
00:37:28<Kita> They work hard to get things the way they like them, and coming in and destroying it is mean.
00:37:29<Kita> D:
00:37:31<Laevos> Yes yes, Lilith is a horrible person who destroys other players ~works of art~
00:37:33<Laevos> Don't care!
00:37:36<Laevos> 'Tis a video game
00:37:39<Kita> Not about art.
00:37:39<Laevos> I play it so that I can have fun
00:37:45<Kita> Its about player progress.
00:37:47<Laevos> Tell that to the people I griefed! :3
00:38:13<Kita> They view the creation of art as a luxury, if they are playing survival, and an investment, if they are playing creative.
00:38:40<Laevos> I view it as a video game in both cases
00:38:51<Kita> Video games can mean something.
00:38:51<Laevos> and have more fun breaking people's stuff than actually making things!
00:38:56<Kita> Books mean something, too.
00:38:59<Laevos> Yeah, and to me they mean entertainment :D
00:39:14<Kita> But you don't go ripping pages out of people's books to prevent them from reading the ending.
00:39:21<Laevos> Pfft :P
00:39:25<Laevos> They can always reset the server
00:39:36<Laevos> Or, y'know
00:39:37<Laevos> ban me :D
00:39:44<Laevos> That's usually what ends up happening if there's moderation
00:39:51<Kita> Still doesn't make it okay, Lilith.
00:39:59<Kita> Kita doesn't even play Minecraft.
00:39:59<Laevos> Maybe not
00:40:03<Laevos> but it is fun >u>
00:40:14<Kita> Its also being a jerk
00:40:17<Laevos> Lilith has no morality in video games!
00:40:23<Laevos> Then Lilith is a jerk, omggg~
00:40:39<Laevos> My little brother and I bonded once, griefing a server
00:40:44<Laevos> it was great
00:40:51<Kita> It just seems hypocritical
00:41:07<Laevos> we giggled when the mods told me that the two of us were MORALLY BEREFT
00:41:27<Kita> They may have reacted more harshly than necessary
00:41:37<Laevos> I'm glad they did, it was funny :D
00:41:38<Kita> But that doesn't make trolling them any form of okay.
00:41:53 Kita: doesn't see how making people upset is funny.
00:42:15<Laevos> That's okay
00:42:22<Laevos> we don't all have to have the same sense of humor!
00:44:14<Laevos> I haven't played Minecraft in years, anyway
00:44:45<Kita> It is much harder to grief, and instead of banning you, they hunt you
00:44:50<Kita> Via your IP address
00:45:04<Laevos> Oh? :P
00:45:09<Kita> And troll your e-mail accounts and stuff.
00:45:12<Laevos> lol
00:45:18<Kita> It isn't funny.
00:45:20<Laevos> Like I use my e-mail account with Minecraft
00:45:39<Kita> They get so upset that they justify actually hurting your real life status.
00:45:49<Laevos> That's pretty much /why/ I grief people
00:45:57<Laevos> because they do such silly things!
00:47:59<Laevos> Also because people's priorities make no sense to me
00:48:00<Laevos> like
00:48:22<Laevos> nothing that I have ever admitted to anybody EVER has gotten as negative a reaction as "I grief in Minecraft."
00:48:57<Kita> Because it is the internet equivalent of vandalising someone's home.
00:49:04<Laevos> Ha xD
00:49:26<Laevos> Also people have been using the "I'M GOING TO FUCKING HACK YOU" line forEVER
00:49:32<Laevos> number of times it's happened...? Zero ;)
00:49:36<Kita> Minecraft is a very personal game. You invest a lot of time and effort into creating a sustainable fortress that you refer to as "your house."
00:49:48 Laevos: doesn't care :D
00:49:59<Laevos> If you want to make something that personal, don't allow other people to edit it
00:50:35<Kita> People have this social contract, kind of like we do in real life, where we don't just walk into people's houses and start destroying them.
00:50:48<Laevos> Yeah except with one difference
00:50:51<Laevos> is a video game :P
00:51:05<Kita> Okay? And? It isn't allowed to be personal, because it is a game?
00:51:26<Laevos> They can have it be personal to them if they want... that's probably a bad decision on their part, but I'm not going to say that they can't
00:51:41<Laevos> ...I'm also not going to stop griefing them just because they take a fucking video game that seriously :D
00:51:45<Kita> Despite the fact that games, much like movies, books, art, music, and real life, have the capacity to inspire real emotions and allow people to bond and develop connections?
00:52:03<Laevos> Yeah, they should take the proper security measures if they don't want things like that to happen
00:52:06<Laevos> it's really fucking easy
00:52:24<Kita> This whole "its just a video game lol" is a really archaic (internet archaic, not real-life archaic) justification for just being an asshole.
00:52:27<Laevos> One of the best ones ever was a PvP world
00:52:34<Laevos> Then Lilith is an asshole.
00:52:37<Laevos> I'm fine with that.
00:52:41<Laevos> anyway
00:52:56<Laevos> my friend and I were playing, and we managed to fill the entire spawn with lava
00:53:11<Laevos> that whole server had to get taken down and reset, it was pretty glorious xux
00:53:20<Kita> Then what prevents you from going and kicking some random person's door in and start breaking holes in their walls with a sledgehammer?
00:53:28<Laevos> It's not a video game.
00:53:35<Laevos> And I'm not a sociopath :P
00:53:45<Laevos> Kita, come on
00:53:47<Kita> So, when being an asshole has real-life consequences, you cease being an asshole.
00:53:49<Kita> Strange.
00:53:59<Laevos> don't use the same analogy that the fucking "Video games cause violence" people use
00:54:05<Laevos> don't stoop to that level
00:54:05<Kita> Kita isn't.
00:54:07<Laevos> Oh?
00:54:12<Laevos> Yes she is.
00:54:17<Laevos> Kita, come on.
00:54:25<Kita> Kita is trying to show Lilith why being an asshole accomplishes nothing.
00:54:34<Laevos> Nothing except provide me with entertainment_
00:54:40<Laevos> Which is reason enough for me!
00:54:55<Laevos> I mean, you can say that my personal entertainment has no value if you want
00:54:57<Laevos> it's fine if you think that
00:54:58<Laevos> like
00:55:08<Laevos> you don't have to think that anything I do, say or think has even the slightest value
00:55:11<Laevos> but it still will to me :3
00:55:14<Kita> Aren't there... just more constructive ways to get your jollies off?
00:55:37<Laevos> I'm not a constructive person! :D
00:55:47<Laevos> Anyway, there's a reason I haven't done it in years, it got kind of borin
00:55:48<Laevos> *boring
00:55:54<Laevos> but when I was doing it, it was fun
00:56:14<Laevos> and I do not and never will feel the slightest emotional conflict about playing a video game in a way that made other people upset.
00:56:29<Laevos> People also get upset when they lose. Does that make me not play video games? No. :P
00:56:38<Kita> That is a sociopathic tendency.
00:56:43<Kita> Like...
00:56:48<Laevos> Hahaha, k
00:56:55<Kita> The inability to empathise with a person's capacity for negative emotions.
00:57:01<Laevos> I empathise perfectly fine
00:57:10<Laevos> I just don't care when it's in the context of a video game
00:57:29<Laevos> because I feel no sympathy for someone who gets so worked up their Minecraft house being destroyed.
00:57:35<Kita> Then you fell for the nineties anti-gaming propaganda.
00:57:41<Laevos> Okay.
00:57:44<Kita> Which is fine
00:57:55<Kita> Because you can't help that, really.
00:58:03<Laevos> I've had so many people have this conversation with me.
00:58:13<Laevos> And you know what the only thing it ever accomplishes is?
00:58:17<Laevos> It just makes me want to go back and do it more
00:58:23<Kita> Well, its like deleting someone's Pokemon save file.
00:58:30<Laevos> because the fact that this is such a terrible thing to you and others makes me want to go back and do it, again and again and again
00:58:36<Laevos> just to get more and more of these delicious reaction
00:58:48<Laevos> so you should really quit while you're behind, you're just encouraging tendencies that you describe as sociopathic.
00:58:57<Kita> If someone puts a lot of time and effort into something... Your first reaction is to smash it and watch them be upset?
00:59:14<Laevos> Only if it's a Minecraft house.
00:59:21<Laevos> Since, you know, I can differentiate between that and other things.
00:59:29<Kita> But it is the same thing as a sculpture.
00:59:33<Kita> Just digitised.
00:59:44<Laevos> No, I literally only have the impulse with Minecraft houses.
00:59:48<Laevos> Maybe you don't differentiate, but I do. :)
01:00:12<Kita> Why are they different
01:00:23<Laevos> Because they're literally different things in real life.
01:01:04<Laevos> I think Kita must secretly like griefing, too, since she's encouraging me to do it so fervently.
01:01:11<Kita> At their base, they aren't. They both take a pre-established figure, and alter it into another by human manipulation for the purpose of aesthetic beauty attainment.
01:01:38<Laevos> Yeah, but one of them is in Minecraft. You really don't have the ability to tell me what objects I can and can't differentiate between.
01:02:05<Kita> Kita wants to find the basis of the differentiation.
01:02:18<Kita> This has become for of an exercise in curiosity than goal attainment.
01:02:20<Laevos> I've already told you.
01:02:23<Kita> more of*
01:02:27<Laevos> One is in Minecraft, and one isn't.
01:02:52<Kita> But what sets Minecraft apart?
01:02:59<Laevos> It's Minecraft!
01:03:16<Kita> You hate circles, because they are circles.
01:03:20<Kita> Got it.
01:03:35<Laevos> I'm glad we understand each other, that kinda took you a while, though. :c
01:04:03<Kita> I dunno. Kind of sounds like racism, just less impactful on society.
01:04:12<Kita> Like, obviously not equating it...
01:04:23<Kita> But just a minor version of the same thought process.
01:04:36<Kita> Just, you don't attempt to justify it.
01:04:49<Kita> Probably due to its lack of societal impact.
01:04:50<Laevos> I'm not /actually/ going to justify griefing in Minecraft to you
01:04:51<Laevos> like
01:05:09<Laevos> I don't feel any need to
01:05:11<Laevos> so I'm just being silly
01:05:20<Kita> Yeah, because of its lack of societal impact.
01:05:22<Laevos> because I don't feel any need to justify myself. I played a videogame in a way that was fun to me.
01:05:25<Laevos> That's it, the end.
01:05:34<Kita> It isn't like you're going out and killing hispanics.
01:06:19<Kita> Kita feels bad when she causes anyone to be upset.
01:06:28<Laevos> Do you feel bad right now? o:
01:06:38<Kita> Not really? You don't seem upset.
01:06:51<Kita> You seem defensive, but not upset.
01:07:02<Laevos> Silly foxie
01:07:05 Laevos: patpats
01:07:11<Laevos> Lilith only gets defensive when she's upset. :3
01:08:11<Laevos> But, okay
01:08:15<Laevos> because you're /you/
01:08:18<Laevos> I'll give this some thought
01:08:24<Laevos> why do I like to grief in video games
01:08:25<Laevos> hmm
01:08:27<Laevos> tricky tricky
01:09:17<Kita> Common reasons for regular vandalism are empowerment, territorial behaviour, or minor sadistic emergence.
01:10:20<Laevos> Tsk tsk, those comments won't get you any progress. Any time you see one of those come up as a a dialogue option, you should know that it'll get you a bad end. :c
01:10:56<Laevos> Anyway
01:13:54<Laevos> the only thing that I can think of that gives me a similar feeling is taking things apart and getting them to work in a new way. Finding glitches in video games and exploiting them, opening things up (usually not putting them back together), I've liked these kinds of things since I was very little. Technology was and is something to break apart look at its guts 
01:15:39<Kita> Then it is a form of empowerment. Hear Kita out
01:15:47<Laevos> omg Kita
01:15:56<Laevos> have you ever even /played/ a visual novel/dating sim before?
01:15:57<Laevos> Sheesh!
01:16:01<Kita> :P
01:16:16<Kita> Kita finds dating sims to be cheesy and unrealistic, baby.
01:16:21 Kita: kisses her cheek.
01:16:24<Laevos> Well yeah
01:16:26<Laevos> they're the worst
01:16:26<Kita> Seriously, though...
01:16:42<Kita> Taking apart something gives you power of the object in question.
01:16:55<Kita> You get to decide what will become of the device.
01:17:09<Kita> And not only that, it gives you an intimate knowledge of the thing in question.
01:17:17<Laevos> Haha yeah right!
01:17:22<Laevos> I don't know shit about anything :c
01:17:25<Kita> It gives both physical and intellectual power over the device.
01:17:45<Kita> Hey, taking something apart is the first step towards learning how to put it back together.
01:18:08<Laevos> Maybe for somebody with actual skill or ability to learn <3
01:18:14<Kita> But putting something back together can be frustrating, and reinstall the feelings of a lack of empowerment.
01:18:32<Laevos> Lilith's just a sadistic, unintellectual, unartistic asshole
01:18:36<Kita> Does Lilith have feelings of worthlessness or impotency?
01:18:47<Kita> Answer seems to be yes.
01:18:50<Kita> >>;;
01:18:53<Laevos> Lilith always feels worthless.
01:18:57<Laevos> Well, not always
01:19:00<Laevos> but a lot of the time!
01:19:05<Laevos> Lilith would like to be more impotent
01:19:08<Laevos> maybe get a vascetomy
01:19:12<Kita> That doesn't make one sadistic, unintellectual, or unartistic.
01:19:21<Laevos> Okay~
01:19:28<Kita> Sometimes it causes people to act like an asshole, though.
01:19:30<Laevos> But griefing in minecraft doessssssss
01:19:51<Kita> Destroying things that people spend time on, does.*
01:20:12<Kita> Lilith has chosen the specific outlet due to the ability to trivialise it.
01:20:26<Laevos> I don't know why you're spending so much time encouraging behavior that you give the pretense of finding disdainful.
01:20:36<Laevos> You're gonna give me a relapse <3
01:21:16<Kita> Kita is attempting to dissect a compulsion, so Kita can help Lilith turn it into something constructive.
01:21:40<Kita> Lilith would feel better if she could be constructive. It is a natural desire of people to want to be contributors.
01:21:54<Laevos> Alright, but be careful of how far you go, otherwise you'll just make me download Minecraft again.
01:22:06<Laevos> And Minecraft is so fucking boring ;-;
01:22:10<Laevos> Don't make me play Minecraft, Kita.
01:22:17<Kita> Lilith views constructivity as an exercise of power.
01:22:24<Kita> Powerful people make things.
01:22:38<Kita> This idea is heaavily enforced by oligarchial culture!
01:22:50<Laevos> Then why am I a sub oooooooooooooooooooo
01:22:58<Laevos> fit that into your logic oooo
01:23:16<Kita> Because subs have the power to direct attention.
01:23:22<Kita> Subs call to doms.
01:23:30<Laevos> ur jus doing it 4 attention omgggg
01:23:31<Kita> They bring the dom to them, or make the dom focus on them.
01:23:44<Kita> It isn't bad to want attention.
01:23:56<Kita> But, having the attention of someone isn't the goal here.
01:24:05<Laevos> I dunno why you think I'm in the mood for any of this right now. x_x
01:24:11<Kita> You want a power over them, in some regard. To make them feel things.
01:24:22<Laevos> Alright
01:24:56<Kita> Your submissiveness makes them feel emotions, and you don't have to feel anything, or you can feel the real emotions. Whichever you so choose, while they HAVE to feel the emotions, because you're stimulating a RESPONSE.
01:25:16<Laevos> cool
01:25:17<Kita> You are the catalyst.
01:25:23<Kita> This makes you feel good.
01:25:32<Laevos> neato
01:25:58<Kita> Is Kita wrong?
01:26:29<Laevos> I mean, yeah, if we're talking about things that I actually feel in real life, then yes.
01:26:40<Laevos> But you're free to continue to speculate/make things up about an imaginary person.
01:27:00<Kita> So... You're entirely certain that these ideas NEVER spring up in your subcon?
01:27:23<Laevos> As sure as I'm capable of being.
01:27:31<Kita> You don't yearn for the power to do SOMETHING that you cannot currently do?
01:27:47<Kita> Ever?
01:28:01<Laevos> Not as far as I know.
01:28:20<Kita> And would NEVER exercise, subconsciously, a lack of power in something completely unrelated?
01:28:56<Laevos> I don't really know what you mean by that.
01:29:22<Kita> Despite the fact that this psychological profile is applicable to 100% of humanity at SOME POINT in their lives?
01:29:53<Laevos> [citation needed]
01:30:05<Kita> People feel powerless in their lives.
01:30:12<Kita> It is part of the human experience.
01:30:35<Kita> It is completely natural to seek power wherever they can, when they are missing it from a part of life they view as important.
01:30:44<Kita> That's like... Psych 101.
01:31:07<Laevos> So is your extrapolation from "You feel something that 100% of humans feel" going to be "This is why you grief in Minecraft?"
01:31:21<Laevos> Because to be honest I don't really see what this has to do with anything.
01:31:53<Laevos> Again, not really sure what internal forces are convincing you that I'm in the mood to be cooperative with... anything related to this entire line of discussion.
01:32:46<Laevos> Hell, *griefed, I should say, since it's been, what... three years since I've even had it installed on a computer that I own?
01:33:10<Kita> Maybe because while you don't think you want to know why you do things that make people not like you... You subconsciously do, but are so consciously focused on disliking yourself that it interrupts the natural desire to improve yourself?
01:34:53<Laevos> I worked really hard to build up this little facade of recovery after my whole panicking thing earlier. I really put a lot of time and effort and emotional energy into it. It's not very nice of you to just come along and break it apart. </3
01:36:41<Kita> Identifying that you are completely capable of being a statistical norm is breaking apart the facade of recovery?
01:37:09<Laevos> You're distressing me. <3
01:37:19<Kita> Telling you that you can be okay, we just need to talk and work towards it...
01:37:29<Kita> Because that is what Kita is trying to do.
01:37:34<Kita> She wants Lilith to be okay.
01:38:00<Laevos> We all have our motives, some more respectable than others.
01:38:20<Laevos> Admittedly, wanting to help me is a much more ~morally sound~ motive than wanting to derive entertainment.
01:38:29<Laevos> But I'm still feeling pretty distressed. 
01:40:08<Kita> What is the actual stressor, here?
01:40:14<Kita> Do you just not like being under the scope?
01:40:39<Kita> Or do you not like someone explaining what they see under the scope?
01:41:08<Kita> Or is it both?
01:41:29<Laevos> The first one, and I don't like explaining myself to others.
01:41:39<Laevos> This is why I don't make more than one visit to any given therapist/doctor
01:41:40<Laevos> ever.
01:41:49<Laevos> It always happens.
01:43:02<Kita> If it doesn't, the reason you would go to one doesn't get fixed.
01:43:30<Kita> It only becomes agitated.
01:43:47<Kita> Like how salt feels in a wound.
01:43:56<Kita> Yeah... it hurts. It is uncomfortable.
01:44:05<Kita> But salt is a pretty decent disinfectant.
01:44:35<Laevos> Yeah, I ne ver get fixed
01:44:45<Kita> Because you only go once.
01:44:49<Laevos> I probably never will
01:44:51<Laevos> for that reason.
01:45:13<Kita> You can just rub salt into an infected hole in your leg one time, and expect it to be a cure-all.
01:45:34<Kita> can't*
01:46:07<Kita> In fact, an infected wound needs to be poked and prodded... drained, probably cleaned up or sealed...
01:46:56<Kita> Kita wants Lilith to get better.
01:47:02<Kita> Lilith wants to not hurt anymore.
01:47:05<Laevos> Lilith knows...
01:47:12<Laevos> sometimes she wants not to hurt anymore*
01:47:24<Laevos> sometimes she wants the hurt to never go away so it swallows her up and destroys everything else
01:47:29<Laevos> at least, that's what it seems like
01:47:29<Kita> ...
01:47:41<Kita> Which is kind of like suicide
01:47:45<Laevos> yeah
01:47:48<Kita> With is the same as not hurting anymore.
01:47:52<Kita> Lilith wants an end.
01:47:58<Kita> But
01:48:00<Laevos> sometimes it's like suicide
01:48:04<Laevos> sometime it's suffering forever...
01:48:16<Laevos> since Lilith doesn't believe in hell
01:48:28<Laevos> staying alive is sometimes the most seemingly self-destructive option
01:48:32<Kita> Lilith does need to go under the scope.
01:48:43<Kita> And she needs to understand...
01:48:54<Kita> Being analysed is step 1 to being fixed.
01:48:57<Laevos> Under the Silph Scope ;-;
01:49:03 Kita: rubs her ears.
01:49:15<Laevos> Lilith isn't stupid.
01:49:18<Laevos> She knows that.
01:49:22<Laevos> But... she probably won't do it.
01:49:26<Kita> She should!
01:49:58<Kita> Lilith wants to be Kita's good kitty, yeah?
01:50:00<Laevos> She also knows this x_x
01:50:01<Laevos> and yes
01:50:08<Laevos> but she always... doesn't
01:50:21<Kita> Lilith wants to be Kita's good kitty for as long as she can, yes?
01:50:43<Laevos> Yes x_x but sometimes Lilith seems to do things that are destructive to her wants and goals
01:50:51<Laevos> like not going in to work more than one day last week
01:51:10<Laevos> staying up until 4AM and sleeping in until 2PM and effectively wasting a whole week except for an evening or two
01:51:16<Kita> Lilith does this because things are uncomfortable.
01:51:32<Kita> Lilith needs to learn to cope with discomfort.
01:51:37<Kita> That is entry level stuff.
01:51:43<Kita> Kita and Lilith can do that together.
01:51:43<Kita> <3
01:51:48<Laevos> <3 x_x
01:52:11<Kita> Humans are all about defense mechanisms.
01:52:39<Laevos> Maybe if therapists used IRC, I could talk to them more frequently.
01:52:39<Kita> Shelters and clothes were developed to defend us from the elements.
01:52:47 Kita: nuzzles Lilith.
01:53:15<Laevos> Not my fault they're sticking solely to methods of communication that I'm bad at.
01:53:37<Kita> Then attempt written communication!
01:53:53<Kita> Seriously, this is a thing that psychologists do.
01:54:07<Kita> If you can't talk to them... Write on paper, or type.
01:54:37<Kita> If talking is a trigger...
01:54:42<Kita> You don't have to talk.
01:54:58<Kita> You do have to inform them that you have discomfort with talking.
01:55:20<Kita> Otherwise they'll be confused, but an e-mail is very affective at giving them a first glance.
01:56:41<Laevos> Yeah... x_x
01:56:44<Laevos> I just don't believe in myself
01:56:48<Laevos> maybe if I were Naruto
01:57:15<Laevos> Or w/e
01:57:34 Kita: rubs
01:58:00<Laevos> I have no faith that I'm going to put any of this to use
01:58:15<Laevos> because I know me..
01:59:03<Kita> Then have faith in your goddess to give her good kitty the strength she needs to put it to use.
01:59:44 Laevos: whines ;-;
01:59:48<Laevos> I don't know what to do
02:01:05<Kita> Purr for your deity
02:01:09 Kita: rubs her chin
02:01:23 Laevos: purrs, collapsing against a bit... <3
02:03:15<Kita> Simple tasks are good, yes?
02:03:39<Kita> Like... when Kita broke down cleaning your place...
02:03:44<Kita> It made it feel surmountable.
02:03:52<Kita> Completeable, yes?
02:04:45<Laevos> Yes Goddess... ;////////;
02:06:00<Kita> For reals, yes?
02:06:33<Laevos> Yes ;-;
02:07:50<Kita> Then you should do that for things that seem insurmountable.
02:08:57<Kita> Break it down into simpler, smaller tasks.
02:09:06<Laevos> I need Kita's help ;n;
02:11:46<Kita> Lilith can come to Kita for help.
02:11:46<Kita> Kita will help teach Lilith how to do it.
02:12:15<Laevos> But Kita isn't here 24/7 ;-;
02:12:36<Kita> Kita always reads anything Lilith posts.
02:12:39<Kita> <3
02:13:15<Laevos> I know... but sometimes I need to make snap decisions...
02:13:54<Kita> Which is why Kita can teach Lilith.
02:14:15 Laevos: clings on ;-;

21:55:12<Kita> Nuuu
21:55:17<Kita> 400 Cursors.

22:55:50<Laevos> ...
22:55:55<Kita> ?
22:55:55<Laevos> he just posted about the concert in general
22:56:00<Kita> D:
22:56:00<Laevos> "Things I take away from RockFest:"
22:56:05<Laevos> "Smoke, mud, and boobs."
22:56:28<Kita> Lame.
22:56:39<Laevos> I dunno
22:56:57<Laevos> he's been posing a bunch of silly anti-feminist, borderline MRA crap recently, so I've been kind of concerned :c
22:57:01<Laevos> Might need to have an intervention.
22:57:08<Kita> Probably needs one.
22:57:31<Laevos> ;~;
23:03:15<Laevos> He pretty much told me that his sexual standards for women are based on anime and straight porn.
23:03:45<Kita> So, he is unrealistic and probably a chick deterrent?
23:04:31<Laevos> He hangs out with a bunch of anime/homestuck girls, so, according to him, he could have... I don't even want to use his choice of words, because it's gross
23:04:48<Laevos> but apparently if he wanted to have sex, it would be pretty trivial. At least, according to him.
23:05:08<Kita> Pfff...
23:05:12<Kita> Homestuck girls?
23:05:15<Laevos> Yeah
23:05:20<Laevos> I dunno
23:05:23<Laevos> mostly like
23:05:23<Kita> What
23:05:24<Laevos> 15-18
23:05:25<Laevos> err
23:05:27<Laevos> 15-17
23:05:35<Kita> Okay, sooo... He's a creep?
23:06:38<Laevos> I dunno. He hangs out with them a lot, but apparently he isn't at all interested; he's apparently had a few of them 'confess their attraction' to him (the way he described it is absolutely vomit-inducing, like something out of a bad visual novel), but he always tell them straight away that he isn't interested
23:06:51<Laevos> so I guess it's at least something that he doesn't take advantage of their apparent willingness?
23:06:52<Laevos> I dunno.
23:07:26<Kita> Or it is a lie.
23:07:29<Kita> o.o;
23:07:34<Laevos> I guess
23:07:39<Laevos> He doesn't seem the type, though
23:08:40<Kita> The best liars don't tell lies.
23:08:51 Laevos: shrugs
23:09:18<Kita> Also, Homestuck girls just... Doesn't sound very good. It almost sounds like a form of objectification.
23:09:29<Laevos> Well
23:09:34 Kita: is a Homestuck fan, but would never call herself a "Homestuck girl"
23:09:34<Laevos> it was derisive, I guess :c
23:09:52<Laevos> I mean, I guess I can't say "homestuck fan" without a bit of derision being throwin in there
23:09:55<Laevos> but that's just how he described it
23:10:30<Kita> Same for anime girls, but there is a little less of the feeling... Because there is the "Anime Girl" stereotype of the girls who watch Naruto and think they are "anime fans"
23:10:45<Kita> When Naruto isn't really an anime, and is more a cartoon.
23:11:53<Kita> Yeah... technically it is anime, because it is a japanese cartoon... but it is a poor representative for anime, and while it is popular, it is popular with younger kids and teens, and with older folks its quality is heavily debated.
23:12:01<Kita> Like... Its a gateway anime.
23:13:48<Laevos> Oh wait, he just posted something about the molestation
23:13:54<Laevos> "I saw this at Rockfest. Lead singer of Staind got PISSED at some guys that molested a girl who was crowd surfing. Starts at :40"
23:14:09<Kita> o.o
23:15:22<Laevos> And if I was going to call something not "real" anime, I'd probably say Miyazaki stuff :P Anime for people who don't like anime >u>
23:15:28<Laevos> Not that I think it's /bad/ of course
23:15:58<Kita> Miyazaki films are actually REALLY representative of anime, in general.
23:16:09<Laevos> I don't think so at all.
23:16:19<Laevos> That's like the super-accessible version of anime.
23:16:39<Kita> Young protagonists... Simple plots... Fantasy treated without fear, but instead with wonder or indifference...
23:16:49<Kita> It isn't a Shonen or a Harem...
23:16:52<Laevos> Yeah, I'm not buying it.
23:17:06<Kita> Its true, though.
23:17:09<Laevos> It'll always be anime for people who don't like anime. That doesn't mean that anime-fans can't like it, too, of course.
23:17:19<Laevos> Not buying it. :P You can say something is true all you want, that won't change my mind.
23:17:20<Kita> Also
23:17:25<Kita> Can Anime grow the fuck up
23:17:38<Kita> Tired of fucking high school kids in all the animu eva
23:17:44<Laevos> Nah
23:18:04 Kita: wants an anime that features adults who do things more than awkwardly avoid sexual tension.
23:18:05<Kita> ;.;
23:18:57<Laevos> Pfft
23:19:06<Laevos> that will probably nevar happen :c
23:19:24<Kita> Seriously though...
23:19:28<Kita> More anime like that.
23:19:33<Kita> We had Cowboy Bebop.
23:19:35<Kita> D:
23:19:37<Laevos> Yeah yeah
23:19:43<Kita> and while Kita isn't into that show...
23:19:51<Kita> It is an example of what Kita is talking about.
23:19:58<Laevos> Yeah, it's fine
23:19:59<Laevos> good animu
23:20:02<Kita> Space western
23:20:05<Kita> ;.;
23:20:20<Laevos> Brother in da Hood was good
23:20:28<Kita> Horror anime would be nice to see OUTSIDE OF A FUCKING HIGH SCHOOL
23:20:35<Kita> x.x
23:20:39<Laevos> (By which I mean Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood)
23:20:48 Kita: did like FMA
23:20:52<Kita> Both versions.
23:20:57<Kita> Brotherhood was better.
23:21:00<Laevos> Too bad Junji Ito stuff would probably not work as an anime.
23:21:03<Laevos> And yeah it was.
23:21:03<Kita> But the original was also good.
23:21:09<Laevos> Also yes
23:21:13<Kita> Hey
23:21:15<Kita> Hey hey
23:21:20<Kita> Lt. Col Hughes
23:21:39<Kita> "Mommy, I miss daddy."
23:21:55<Kita> Instant "bawwww" from most fans of the series.
23:21:58<Laevos> "Your daddy is dead lol."
23:22:02<Laevos> Oh wait nobody ever said that
23:22:03<Laevos> but yeah
23:22:05<Kita> It was sad, though.
23:22:09<Laevos> kya
23:22:11<Laevos> *ya
23:22:12<Laevos> It was
23:22:17<Kita> :<
23:22:26<Kita> If any character DIDN'T deserve to die
23:22:30<Kita> It was totally Hughes.
23:22:43<Laevos> Just goes to show u
23:23:05<Laevos> I don't know what it shows you
23:23:06<Laevos> but uh
23:23:35<Kita> But yeah.
23:23:42<Kita> FMA is an example that Shonen can be good.
23:23:52<Kita> (Shounen?)
23:23:58<Kita> (Shonen? Fuck)
23:23:58<Laevos> I think it's shounen
23:24:00<Laevos> I dunno
23:24:04<Laevos> I know what you mean
23:24:06<Kita> D:
23:24:18<Laevos> Have you seen Princess Jellyfish?
23:24:24<Kita> "Anime about dudes and chicks fighting eachother with powuhs"
23:24:34<Kita> And...
23:24:35<Kita> No?
23:24:41<Kita> Is that the one
23:24:44<Kita> With the squidgirl
23:24:47<Laevos> No
23:24:50<Kita> Who looks like-
23:24:51<Kita> Okay
23:24:52<Laevos> That's Squid Girl
23:24:55<Kita> Yeah
23:24:59<Laevos> (Which is also good)
23:24:59<Kita> Why does that have fans
23:25:02<Kita> She is six
23:25:02<Kita> D:
23:25:07<Kita> She looks like she is six
23:25:07<Laevos> It's like
23:25:16<Laevos> (She probably is six, six year olds can be funny, too)
23:25:18<Laevos> but anyway
23:25:23<Laevos> it's like Invader Zim mixed with Sgt. Frog
23:25:24<Laevos> it's amazing
23:25:31<Laevos> love the whole incompetent invader thing.
23:25:48<Kita> Invader Zim had some really interesting Fridge Horror.
23:26:03<Laevos> I loved Invader Zim
23:26:10<Laevos> I don't care how many crappy Hot Topic shirts they made
23:26:13<Laevos> I loved that show :3
23:26:16<Kita> And considering that the guy who did Invader Zim did a totally bonkers comic called "Johnny, The Homicidal Maniac"
23:26:22<Kita> Oh, Kita likes Zim, too.
23:26:30<Kita> And Kita liked JtHM, too.
23:26:41<Kita> Jhonen Vasquez is cool beans, yo.
23:26:45<Laevos> Yeah, he's cool
23:26:50<Laevos> I've got all of the JtHM comics right here
23:26:52<Laevos> in this very room
23:26:56<Kita> What
23:26:58<Kita> No way
23:26:59<Kita> D:
23:27:02<Laevos> ...way o:
23:27:08<Kita> So does Kita

23:28:32<Kita> Iron Man... The only superhero who decided to take a life-ending injury and use toothpicks and uranium to turn it into a super power.

23:35:53<Kita> Murder EVERYWHERE.
23:36:15<Laevos> Yeah, they've got pretty big shoes to fill when it comes to dogma that's inspired shitty things.
23:37:07<Kita> However, moneygreed?
23:37:13<Kita> Scientology beats that.
23:37:29<Kita> Also, naming your religion after SCIENCE?

03:09:20<Kita> Sounds like Resident Evil meets Video Game Cutscene
03:09:54<Laevos> oooo
03:10:07<Kita> And not
03:10:11<Kita> Video Game Resi
03:10:14<Kita> Movie Resi
03:10:15<Laevos> The movie?
03:10:19<Laevos> Ah okay
03:10:23<Kita> And while the movies aren't super awesome
03:10:31<Kita> The music was really good for the first two.
03:10:36<Laevos> Uguu~
03:10:40<Laevos> Oh I was thinking of Silent Hill
03:10:41<Laevos> haha oops
03:10:44<Kita> Yeah
03:10:51<Kita> Silent Hill was better.
03:10:52<Kita> :P
03:10:54<Laevos> Yeah
03:10:56<Laevos> 4real
03:11:14<Laevos> I'm glad it didn't hurt your ears hopefully
03:11:16<Laevos> <3
03:11:26<Kita> But this is just missing some distorted xylophone or crystal wine glasses
03:11:31<Laevos> Hehehe
03:11:34<Laevos> I'll get around to it
03:11:45<Kita> And then it'll sound like a redux of the first movie's main theme.
03:11:48<Laevos> that program's kinda clunky
03:11:53<Laevos> Haha, cool :3
03:12:02<Kita> Clunk~

12:42:33 Laevos: nuzzles
12:42:39<Laevos> got out of my first class super early
12:42:43 Kita: kisses her cheek.
12:43:19<Laevos> we looked over the syllabus with the instructor while she had some kind of internet radio on, then she told us that we could go smoke weed and enjoy the beautiful day
12:43:29 Laevos: smiles happily and kisses back~
12:43:41<Kita> what class is this?
12:43:49<Laevos> Intro to poetry :P
12:44:08<Kita> Pfff
12:44:12<Kita> Of course
12:44:19<Laevos> About 90% of the students in there are seniors or super-seniors who needed their sophomore English credit (like me!)
12:44:21<Kita> An artistic English class
12:44:52<Laevos> Yeah, it should be pretty easy
12:45:11<Kita> You are silly. The class is silly. Easy Silly A.
12:45:20<Laevos> I know, it's silly
12:45:45<Laevos> but it's a college requirement; it was either that, intro to fiction, intro to drama, or just English 110
12:46:59<Kita> "Intro to Drama"
12:47:11<Kita> Oh fuck, no. No one wants to go to high school a second time.
12:47:16<Laevos> Yeah :P
12:47:22<Laevos> That's a good one, too
12:47:34<Kita> Theatre kids are awful to Kita.
12:47:40<Laevos> :c
12:47:45<Laevos> I never got along with any of them
12:47:54<Laevos> though
12:48:06<Kita> Always trying to get her to "pull her contacts out" or "quit bleaching her hair" and "stop being an attention whore."
12:48:10<Laevos> I didn't really interact with them at all, I guess
12:48:12<Laevos> omg
12:48:14<Kita> :<
12:48:18<Laevos> what a bunch of assholes ;-;
12:48:22 Laevos: hugs Q_Q
12:48:26<Laevos> That's horrible, Goddess ;-;
12:49:03<Kita> Despite the fact that Kita regularly told them that she couldn't do any of those things, due to not being an attention whore and having a genetic mutation.
12:49:05<Kita> But noooo
12:49:20<Laevos> They were too cool to listen, huh? >:c
12:49:36<Kita> You can't be anything but white, brown-haired, brown/green/blue homochromatic eyed, and hip.
12:49:40<Kita> Also skinny.
12:49:51<Kita> If you weren't skinny, you couldn't be a theatre kid.
12:49:59<Kita> Not fit, not muscular, not average...
12:49:59<Laevos> Ugh xnx
12:50:09<Kita> Like... Most of them were bulimic.
12:50:29<Laevos> That's just, bleh. :c
12:50:36<Laevos> I'm so sorry that you had to go through that Q_Q
12:50:46 Laevos: curls up on and kittywarms ;-;
12:53:23<Laevos> Eep, time to go to class, Goddess Dx
12:53:27<Laevos> I'll message you again when I can!
12:53:29<Kita> Okay, lovely.

00:00:55 Laevos: puts on one of her favorite albums ever~~~
00:03:30<Kita> o.o
00:05:38<Laevos> Aeternus - ...and So the Night Became
00:05:54<Laevos> Look at this freaking cover (so pretty): http://www.metal-archives.com/images/2/4/0/4/2404.jpg
00:06:40<Laevos> Lilith found this CD in a Half Price Books... without question, her best "bargain bin" find in her entire life @_@
00:07:12<Kita> Did you ever look into the discography?
00:07:36<Laevos> I just found them randomly when I first discovered the CD, I had never heard of them before, completely blind buy
00:07:58<Laevos> since then, I've also got their debut, but sadly they switched styles after the first few records to a rather bland death metal.
00:08:11<Kita> ;.;
00:08:23<Laevos> It happens :c
00:08:55<Laevos> They released at least two absolute masterpieces, though, the one I'm referring to having a place among the pantheon of Lilith's definite list of "best ever"
00:09:19<Laevos> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HpdcTK_1wk Here's the first song.
00:11:30<Kita> I...
00:11:33<Kita> Hm.
00:11:36<Kita> This...
00:11:40<Laevos> It takes /a while/ for the actual song to start
00:11:42<Laevos> just FYI
00:11:42<Kita> This is...
00:11:43<Kita> Something.
00:11:45<Kita> o.o;
00:11:47<Kita> Still.
00:11:59<Laevos> Though I do like the intro xux
00:12:12<Kita> It reminds Kita of Goths and Arabs
00:12:25<Kita> Except
00:12:34<Kita> Without the shitty make-up and Islam
00:12:50<Laevos> Hehehe
00:13:40<Laevos> It's more mythological than dogmatically religious, this song; all about Ares
00:13:40<Kita> The comments for the vid are all...
00:13:47<Kita> "Hail Eternus"
00:13:54<Kita> Aeternus*
00:14:03<Laevos> That's what metal fans say
00:14:08<Laevos> ETERNAL HAILS
00:14:08<Laevos> etc.
00:14:13<Kita> Uh
00:14:18<Kita> Never encountered that, before.
00:14:20<Laevos> at least, in black metal
00:14:23<Laevos> not so much in like
00:14:25<Kita> Itskindofunsettling
00:14:25<Laevos> power metal and what have you
00:14:30<Laevos> it's kinda cheesy
00:14:36<Kita> Yeah...
00:14:56<Kita> Unless the only other place you've seen it is religion, Hitler, and bad guys in Marvel comics.
00:15:13<Kita> ("Hail Hydra," "All Hail Loki")
00:15:54<Laevos> (Lilith uses "Hails," as the salutation for most of her e-mails to bands, labels and black metal musicians)
00:16:01<Laevos> I can see how it'd be... kinda weird
00:16:18<Kita> "Hail" is an exclamation of worship
00:16:27<Laevos> Yeah
00:16:31<Kita> Practically shorthand for "Hail to the glory of our deity"
00:16:52<Kita> Its usage in history
00:16:56<Laevos> "Blasphemic hellhails~"
00:17:09<Kita> Was mostly to refer to the kings or priests.
00:17:16<Laevos> or "hellhailz" if you're feeling particularly cheeky
00:18:02<Laevos> Honestly these days it's mainly used by super-enthusiastic folks, especially where English isn't their first language
00:18:11<Laevos> as it's just a kind of part of the aesthetic
00:18:13 Kita: nods.
00:18:23<Kita> Doesn't make it less unsettling to Kita.
00:18:25<Laevos> That's okay
00:18:52<Laevos> To be honest, when black metal started out, a lot of the conventions and tropes were designed to unsettle people
00:19:03<Laevos> that's not really so much the case anymore as it's become kind of old hat in a lot of circles
00:19:03<Laevos> but
00:19:20<Laevos> that was at one point, at least, the desired effect
00:19:37 Kita: doesn't mind Death or Black metal... As long as it isn't racist/homophobic/etc... But does not interact with the fans ever, and has never been super-attached to any group.
00:19:57<Laevos> Kita interacts with a black metal fanatic nearly every day ;o
00:20:17<Kita> But Lilith is a one
00:20:20<Kita> Not a many
00:20:32<Laevos> Oh, I misread that
00:20:41<Laevos> as "any fans" instead of "the fans"
00:20:48<Kita> XP

01:56:07<Kita> Stupid
01:56:09<Kita> Dumb
01:56:11<Kita> Corrupted
01:56:14<Kita> Piece of trash
01:56:15<Kita> ;.;
01:56:19 Kita: cries for forever.
01:56:24 Kita: is never happy again.
01:57:59 Kita: throws the fucking hard drive at her wall.
01:58:06<Kita> Everything is not okay.

02:10:50<Laevos> oh no ;-;
02:10:52<Laevos> what happened?
02:10:54<Laevos> I'm so sorry ;-;
02:11:07<Laevos> Goddess...? Q_Q
02:11:16<Kita> The hard drive that Kita kept all of her game code on fried itself.
02:11:21<Kita> Completely unsalvagable.
02:11:42<Kita> The magnets inside fried the backup that was right next to it, in the fit they had after the frying.
02:11:58<Kita> Kita had a freak power surge.
02:12:07<Kita> Like... This really should not have happened.
02:12:30<Kita> It shorted the surge protector, AND fried the protection on the protector.
02:12:41<Kita> So everything plugged into it fried.
02:13:03<Kita> Only two things were plugged in...
02:13:44<Kita> The hard drive that was fried, and TV monitor Kita uses as a screen for her bigger computer.

22:31:03Irssi: Starting query in esper with Kita
22:31:07 Laevos: licks
22:31:33<Kita> Movies you wouldn't expect to see Danny Elfman compose the score for: Real Steel
22:31:45<Kita> Which is BASICALLY Punch Out with robots.
22:31:55<Kita> And Hugh Jackman.
22:31:56<Kita> :P
22:32:17<Kita> It isn't a great movie.
22:32:22<Kita> But it is sweet.
22:32:59<Kita> The robot, itself, despite being a boxing killer...
22:33:03<Kita> Is adourable.
22:33:19<Kita> And they did a good job with the puppeteering and CG on it.
22:33:23<Kita> Looks very convincing.
22:33:26<Kita> Plot is meh.
22:33:32<Kita> Characters are meh. Acting works.
22:34:01<Laevos> Haven't ever heard of it o:
22:34:05<Kita> Yeah...
22:34:51<Kita> It got a little bit of flak from the Homestuck community, because Hussie wrote a comic called "And It Don't Stop" which is rap battles, with robots duking it out based on the flow and rhythm of the rappers.
22:35:19<Kita> (Really good comic, despite the strange concept. Also super stylised, which REALLY helps give it a great feel.)
22:35:38<Kita> and Real Steel has a similar concept behind it, kind of.
22:35:51<Kita> But ultimately...
22:35:55<Laevos> Oh okay
22:36:07<Kita> 7/10. Worth a watch, if you don't mind a little robot violence.
22:36:13<Laevos> ;w;
22:36:39<Kita> (Kita's scale is that 5 is the average. If it is better than five, it is better than the average.)
22:36:56<Laevos> Yeah o:
22:37:04<Kita> (For scale, Groundhog day is only an 8.2...)
22:37:14<Laevos> xD
22:37:16<Kita> (Whereas Titanic is 3.7)
22:37:23<Laevos> Oh my ;u;
22:37:30<Kita> Titanic is a shitty movie.
22:37:36<Kita> Don't know why it was popular.
22:37:40<Laevos> Never saw it, don't doubt it ;w;
22:38:00<Kita> Star Wars Christmas Special is a 1.2
22:38:08<Kita> Not the worst movie Kita has ever seen.
22:38:09<Laevos> Hahahaha xD
22:38:16<Kita> But really, really close.
22:38:25<Kita> The scale is 1-10, not 0-10.
22:38:57<Kita> The worst movie Kita has ever seen...
22:39:14<Kita> Hasbro made a TV series about Hot Wheels.
22:39:20<Laevos> Oh my
22:39:24<Kita> (Not fucking joking. They really did!)
22:39:31<Laevos> I don't doubt it!
22:39:41<Kita> (Or is it Mattel that makes Hot Wheels? Eh. Doesn't matter. One of them.)
22:40:00<Kita> Called like... Highway 55 or some stupid shit like that.
22:40:36<Kita> Where racers in VERY OnlyCouldExistAsAHotWheels-style cars were teleported to an alternate dimension for races... TO THE DEEEEEATH
22:40:38<Laevos> Yeah, I get you
22:40:42<Kita> They made a movie.
22:40:45<Kita> It was...
22:40:46<Laevos> Hahahahahaha xD
22:40:47<Kita> So bad.
22:40:52<Kita> So, so bad.
22:40:58<Laevos> I'm sure xD
22:41:02<Kita> And it was all done in CG
22:41:12<Laevos> Sure, yeah xD
22:41:18<Kita> Like that one early nineties show
22:41:22<Kita> With the green people
22:41:26<Kita> Inside of the video game.
22:41:27<Kita> Yeah.
22:41:33<Laevos> OH GOD
22:41:35<Laevos> ReBoot
22:41:37<Kita> YES
22:41:40<Kita> That was the name.
22:41:44<Laevos> Probably the best show of all time
22:41:46<Kita> The CG looked like that.
22:41:51<Laevos> Hahahahaha xD
22:41:52<Kita> But worse
22:42:05<Laevos> That was the fucking nadir of CG
22:42:05<Kita> Because they were closer to real people in all the wrong ways.
22:42:16<Laevos> What, the cars were? O_O
22:42:20<Kita> No, the PEOPLE.
22:42:23<Kita> There were PEOPLE.
22:42:28<Kita> That drove the cars.
22:42:32<Kita> Yeah, see?
22:42:36<Laevos> Oh okay, so it wasn't Cars.
22:42:38<Kita> Soooooo bad.
22:42:39<Kita> Yeah.
22:42:42<Kita> It wasn't Cars.
22:42:53<Kita> Which is bad, but NO WHERE NEAR as bad as this shit.
22:43:10<Laevos> Yeah, Cars was pretty poopy
22:43:15<Laevos> but I'm sure this was so much worse xux
22:43:30<Kita> Pixar normally hits homeruns.
22:43:39<Kita> Cars was the C-C-C-C-COMBO BREAKER
22:43:47<Kita> </Killer_Instinct>
22:43:58<Laevos> Yeah :c
22:45:03<Kita> Hot Wheels: Highway 35
22:45:06<Kita> Was the name.
22:45:46<Laevos> Nice
22:45:49<Laevos> I-35?
22:45:49<Kita> And they made a TV series called Hot Wheels Battle Force 5
22:46:01<Kita> No... I would be "Interstate"
22:46:08<Laevos> :cccccc
22:46:14<Laevos> I-35 runs through where I live
22:47:05<Kita> And I-5 runs through Roseburg, and is like... a 3 minute drive from Kita's Bro's place here, in Oregon.
22:47:34<Laevos> Ooh
22:48:41<Kita> So yeah
22:48:45<Kita> there you go
22:48:49<Kita> Oh wait
22:49:04<Kita> It is Hot Wheels: Highway 35 - World Race
22:49:09<Kita> Forgot the subsubtitle.
22:49:10<Kita> :P
22:49:26<Kita> as if they intended it to be a series...
22:49:27<Kita> OH WAIT
22:49:29<Kita> IT WAS
22:49:37<Kita> They made a second one, and then a TV SERIES.
22:49:45<Kita> How fucking stupid ARE they
22:49:50<Kita> Seriously though
22:49:53<Kita> It was shit.
22:50:00<Kita> You think Power Rangers is bad?
22:50:13<Kita> At least Power Rangers is a good unintentional ironic comedy.
22:50:47<Kita> Also, Green Ranger, from Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers totally went on to become the WORST UFC fighter... EVER.
22:50:53<Laevos> omg what
22:50:56<Kita> Yes
22:51:01<Kita> Yes, he did.
22:51:02<Laevos> Hahahaha xD
22:51:09<Kita> He has the WORST fight record in the UFC.
22:51:17<Laevos> That's amazing xux
22:51:54<Kita> He could have gone in the ring, tried to KO HIMSELF, and done better than he did.
22:52:42<Kita> And? he is a total prick. The entire cast of the show is known for saying that he is the reason the show didn't last.
22:53:03<Kita> That he made it unbearable for everyone, and that he treated Blue and Yellow Ranger the worst.
22:53:32<Kita> (He also might have been a racist, but Kita can't remember if that was one of the original camera techs or if it was Green Ranger.)
22:53:47<Kita> That might have been the camera tech.
22:54:00<Laevos> Hmm :c
22:54:00<Kita> Kita has weirdly obscure knowledge
22:55:33<Laevos> Just a bit,  yeah? :P
22:56:33 Kita: nosebumps
22:56:37<Kita> Look
22:56:39 Laevos: lickles~
22:56:40 Laevos: looks
22:56:41<Kita> Power Rangers?
22:56:45<Kita> That shit is hilarious.
22:56:47<Laevos> I'll be honest
22:56:51<Laevos> I  never watched power rangers xD
22:56:53<Kita> The totally awful acting
22:56:56<Kita> The fake explosions
22:57:07<Kita> It is... the pinnacle of unintentional comedy.
22:57:15<Kita> So bad that it loops around and becomes good.
22:57:19<Kita> DENOUDDADEN
22:58:07<Laevos> :3
22:58:07<Kita> In the words of Jared Knabenhauber (ProJared)...
22:58:22<Kita> "OH MY GOD, I LOVE MONSTER HUNTER, TWELVE OUT OF TEN!!!"
22:58:37<Laevos> xux
22:58:47<Kita> (He then went and did an extended review, where he gave the game a scord of 8/10)
23:00:04<Laevos> Oh okay
23:00:12<Kita> Yeah.
23:00:18<Laevos> ;w;
23:00:23<Kita> He is actually pretty funny, and a fair reviewer.
23:00:37<Laevos> I've been waiting for this CD FOREVER
23:00:43<Laevos> (and it's rly good)
23:00:44<Kita> o.o
23:01:06<Kita> Its funny
23:01:25<Laevos> http://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Black_Cilice/A_Corpse%2C_a_Temple/413411
23:01:28<Kita> Kita used to call her power and symphonic metal collection "bullshit hipster metal"
23:01:32<Kita> Then she met Lilith.
23:01:33<Laevos> Pfft xD
23:01:33<Kita> :P
23:01:52<Laevos> Hipsters don't listen to power metal
23:01:53<Laevos> they listen to like
23:01:56<Laevos> fucking Alcest and shit >:c
23:02:10<Laevos> Wolves in the Throne Room
23:02:19<Laevos> things of that ilk!
23:02:32<Kita> :P
23:02:40<Kita> Do Hipsters listen to...
23:02:42<Kita> Powerwolf?
23:02:47 Kita: snrks.
23:02:55<Laevos> uhhh
23:03:02<Kita> Oh god
23:03:04<Laevos> probz noy
23:03:05<Kita> Did Kita
23:03:14<Kita> Find a band that Lilith doesn't know
23:03:35<Kita> DID SHE DID SHE DID SHE DID SHE DID SHE
23:03:41<Kita> :3333
23:04:40 Kita: paws at
23:05:25<Kita> Lilicious
23:07:16<Laevos> You've shown me Poewrwolf before
23:07:17<Laevos> REMEMBER?
23:07:20<Laevos> and in any case
23:07:28<Laevos> Lilith doesn't keep up with the power metals
23:07:39<Laevos> There are lots of bands that Lilith doesn't know! o:
23:07:41<Laevos> Probably thousands xux
23:07:50<Laevos> millions\
23:08:03<Kita> Powerwolf is more symphonic than power
23:08:13<Kita> And is like... super generic Satan
23:08:15<Kita> stuff
23:08:25<Kita> Kita keeps it around for ironic purposes.
23:08:39<Kita> Also, because it has an almost... groovyness to it.
23:08:43<Laevos> Yeah
23:08:51<Laevos> that kind of stuff can definitely be groovy
23:08:53<Laevos> sometimes WAY TOO MUCH
23:08:54<Kita> Has a really generic sound, but is like... Symphonic you can dance to.
23:09:01<Laevos> e.g.: later Edguy
23:09:06<Kita> Yes
23:09:08<Laevos> from what Lilith heard of it
23:09:22<Kita> Babylon is powerful and really power metal-sounding
23:09:30<Kita> Rocket Ride is not as powerful...
23:09:42<Laevos> Yeah :c
23:09:43<Kita> For 80s style mixed with modern rock, not alternative, rock.
23:09:51<Kita> For? More*
23:10:16<Kita> Matrix... 9-2-9... Dragonfly
23:10:26<Kita> Though Dragonfly manages to come back to that power...
23:10:38<Kita> But Edguy is less cool because lots of Jesus in middle Edguy.
23:10:44<Kita> Not into the whole religion thing.
23:10:53<Kita> Gives Kita the skin crawlies.
23:11:14<Kita> Powerwolf is an exception, because Anton LaVeyism is more anti-religion than it is religion.
23:11:31<Kita> Still dogma, just a different side of it.
23:11:44<Kita> Outside evil, inner good, instead of outside good, inner evil.
23:13:08<Laevos> Yeah I'm sure there is LOTS OF JESUS
23:13:10<Laevos> :c
23:13:24<Kita> Well like...
23:13:28<Kita> Nailed to the Wheel
23:13:44<Laevos> >>:c
23:13:46<Kita> And a lot of other songs from that time...
23:13:54<Kita> That try to sexualise Christianity.
23:14:22<Kita> And like... Positively sexualise Christianity.
23:15:35<Laevos> so sexy Jesus
23:15:42<Kita> BASICALLY
23:15:56<Kita> And they got pretty sex-obsessed.
23:16:09<Laevos> The wages of righteousness is a striptease from Jesus
23:16:12<Kita> And it is just...
23:16:20<Laevos> sounds pretty bad
23:16:45<Kita> "ehhh... not sure if Kita can like you guys anymore... This is very strange and against a lot of what Kita stands for... BUT IT IS SO FUCKING CATCHY"
23:16:51<Kita> Edguy is the pop of metal.
23:17:10<Laevos> Hahaha xD
23:17:16<Laevos> There's some poppy metal, to be sure
23:17:18<Kita> Its bouncy, and happy, and talks about sex and god.
23:17:25<Kita> That is pop music.
23:17:27<Laevos> but there's a reason that poppy is only one letter away
23:17:28<Laevos> FROM POOPY
23:17:32<Kita> XP
23:17:35<Laevos> the moar u kno
23:17:45<Kita> Hey, hey.
23:17:53<Kita> IT'S RAINING MEN
23:17:58<Kita> HALLELUJAH
23:18:01<Kita> Is a terrible song
23:18:08<Kita> But Michael Jackson was a genius.
23:18:34<Kita> Kita doesn't listen to Michael Jackson
23:18:45<Kita> But she has much, much respect for the king of pop.
23:19:30<Kita> "I may not particularly care for your brand of music, sir... But I must admit that it is structurally sound and shows skill in the realms of composition, poeticism, and performance. Kudos, MJ. Kudos."
23:20:14<Laevos> Pfft xD
23:20:58<Kita> Kita can do that.
23:21:15<Kita> Kita can do the thing where you don't like it, but understand that it is good.
23:21:18<Kita> Also
23:21:19<Kita> https://31.media.tumblr.com/4736858732e7e08299de1d07ac1657a8/tumblr_n73fzqr0Rz1s9bv8lo1_500.gif
23:21:22<Kita> Here you go.
23:21:26<Laevos> Lilith doesn't really care about pop one way or another
23:21:35<Kita> Kita's new favourite Smash Bros. .gif.
23:21:38<Laevos> Zero suit foxus
23:21:52<Kita> Getting her ass slapped by the Master Hand
23:21:53<Kita> Because
23:21:54<Kita> Tumblr
23:22:14<Laevos> I've still never seen a "TUMBLR TUMBLR TUMBLR TUMBLR CATS!" gif.
23:22:16<Laevos> >:c
23:22:31<Laevos> I've been w aiting for it to exist for many a year now
23:22:32<Kita> Well... That is because those are dumb.
23:22:39<Kita> At least
23:22:47<Kita> Tumblr .gifs about Tumblr are dumb.
23:22:53<Laevos> I guess
23:22:57<Kita> But
23:23:00<Laevos> but I still like the sound of tumblr cats
23:23:00<Kita> Why?
23:23:03<Kita> XP
23:23:06<Laevos> because I thought of it one day
23:23:07<Laevos> and I was like
23:23:13<Kita> THEN MAKE IT A THING
23:23:14<Laevos> "Surely someone has already made this, so that I don't have to"
23:23:16<Kita> AND POST IT TO TUMBLR
23:23:21<Laevos> Hehehe
23:23:29<Kita> Find the WORST tumblr pages
23:23:38<Kita> And then the CUTEST kitten ever
23:23:51 Kita: has just the kitten, actually... somewhere on her hard drive.
23:24:03<Laevos> xD
23:27:57<Kita> o.o
23:29:58<Laevos> :3
23:30:34 Kita: will find it, if Lilith ever wants to make that .gif
23:30:42<Laevos> Perhaps xD

02:11:36<Kita> Kita hates League of Legends.
02:12:01<Kita> It has a toxic community, and it is a mediocre game, at best.
02:12:02<Laevos> ;n;
02:12:05<Laevos> Yes
02:12:28<Kita> Kita's channel... Discussions about it are to be kept to a supreme minimum.
02:12:37<Kita> (There are three, very active, players.)
02:13:04<Laevos> Yeah @_@
02:13:12<Kita> Kita has expressed her opinion multiple times, and stated that when they talk about it, she feels like she is being excluded from talking in her own channel.
02:13:41<Kita> Tonight?
02:14:06<Kita> [22:50] <+Snowfire-Music> So Jaclyn's playing League with me and Zem, kita.
02:14:06<Kita> [22:50] <+Snowfire-Music> You should join us.

02:14:57 Kita: has known Snowfire-Music for a very long time. Longer than anyone in the chat, and he is actually really nice.
02:15:02<Laevos> ;n;
02:15:10<Kita> But he doesn't think, sometimes.
02:15:16<Kita> All three of them have that problem.
02:15:22<Laevos> Clearly
02:15:30<Kita> Zemerl is the worst about it, but he avoids conflict, now.
02:15:46<Laevos> why else would they be playing such a game? ;n;
02:15:56<Kita> Addiction.
02:16:05<Kita> But..
02:16:09<Kita> Yeah.
02:16:20<Kita> How could they not know that Kita would say "No."
02:16:27<Kita> And after Kita said no?
02:16:34<Kita> They tried to convince her to play.
02:16:47<Kita> And it was just...
02:16:52<Kita> Ugh. So much disrespect.
02:17:02<Kita> Kita only has two banned topics.
02:17:07<Kita> LoL and MLP:FiM.
02:17:28<Kita> The first makes her angry and defensive...
02:17:37<Kita> And the second one just upsets her, greatly.
02:17:43<Kita> Lots of negative feelings.
02:17:53<Laevos> Such insensitivity is not the proper way to address a Goddess...

15:48:36<Kita> We just gotta be calm, and break it up into smaller, tinier goals.
15:49:01<Kita> Start by breaking the subject of the test into sections.
15:49:16<Kita> Study the sections individually, until you understand them.
15:49:22<Laevos> I just need to get the sheet

15:49:40<Laevos> it's not so much that I think it'll be relaly difficult

15:49:53<Kita> Okay...
15:50:07<Laevos> stressed out lots
15:50:08<Laevos> and then
15:50:09<Kita> Well, if we can just do things one at a time, you'll get through it.
15:50:22<Laevos> people start telling me about giving me drugs in another channel

15:51:09<Kita> All the tasks can take a number.
15:51:19<Kita> You're the Department of Lilith Tasks.
15:51:21<Laevos> that'll take up time though Q_Q
15:51:26<Kita> You can serve one at a time.
15:51:38 Kita: petpats.
15:52:00<Kita> Trust Kita, taking the time to make the process efficient is beneficial.
15:52:05<Kita> Start with the hard stuff.
15:52:21<Kita> Nothing tonight may be hard, but there is probably some difference in difficulty.
15:52:35<Kita> Start with the more difficult, work toward the less difficult.
15:52:48<Kita> Trust foxy.
15:52:54<Kita> She can get pretty kitty through it.
15:52:58<Laevos> yay <3

15:53:52<Kita> Oh. So, you're not gonna be broke for days.
15:53:58<Kita> Okay, that is less pressing.
15:54:17<Kita> Maybe you could bum a meal off a friend or your mom?
15:54:44<Laevos> only way I could do that is if I drove back half an hour to Olathe
15:54:48<Laevos> which I'm scared to do because
15:54:53<Laevos> my car started falling apart yesterday
15:55:04<Kita> D:
15:55:15<Laevos> the trim under the driver-side doors came loose
15:55:18<Laevos> and was just hanging off

15:55:32<Laevos> Yeah I know
15:55:37<Kita> How old is the car?
15:55:40<Laevos> but it also makes even MORE sounds whenever I brake
15:55:45<Laevos> I just need to take it in to the dealership
15:55:45<Laevos> but
15:55:47<Laevos> $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
15:55:59<Kita> Talk to Inkchu.
15:56:07<Kita> She knows cars.
15:56:07<Laevos> ?
15:56:09<Laevos> oh
15:56:16<Laevos> I mean I know what the sound is coming from
15:56:25<Laevos> rubber scraping on plastic
15:56:30<Kita> She can tell you how to fix it yourself.
15:56:30<Kita> :P
15:56:33<Laevos> yeah right
15:56:39<Kita> Yeah, right!
15:56:45<Laevos> no amount of mechanical prowess could help me to not completely fuck it up
15:56:50<Laevos> also it'll surely require tools that I don't have
15:57:01<Laevos> part of the wheel enclosure got physically bent out
15:57:06<Laevos> so that it scrapes against the wheel
15:57:19<Laevos> when I turn a certain angle
15:57:20<Laevos> and now
15:57:21<Laevos> that it's gotten worse

16:54:41<Kita> You could offer your place as a place to meet, but they have to bring food.
16:54:49<Laevos> Hmm... weird thing; I reinstalled the Bluetooth drivers on this computer (because for some reason Motioninjoy replaced them with its own, which don't actually work for Bluetooth file transfer), and now whenever I toggle Caps Lock, a little box appears in the bottom right corner of the screen, saying either "CAPS LOCK: ON" or "CAPS LOCK: OFF"
16:54:52<Laevos> Hehe, that might work :P

17:07:07 Laevos: blinks
17:07:15<Laevos> that does sound rather painful

17:08:10<Laevos> I'll be sure to avoid, erm, dropping any weights between my legs, I guess!
17:08:20<Laevos> anyway
17:08:25<Kita> :D
17:08:26<Laevos> I'm sure there are much cleaner ways to get rid of those
17:09:36 Laevos: shelters herself behind a pillow fortress against the oncoming barrage of people echoing the beginning of the Steam Summer Sale
17:10:10<Kita> :P
17:10:27<Kita> It has begun, it is glorious, Kita probably won't buy anything, this year.
17:10:28<Kita> :P
17:10:32<Laevos> Yeah :D
17:10:41<Laevos> But but but
17:10:45<Laevos> there's a SUMMER ADVENTURE
17:10:46<Laevos> !!!!
17:10:50<Laevos> whatever that means
17:11:12<Kita> The summer adventure... is not really an adventure...
17:11:16<Kita> It is a competition.
17:11:18<Laevos> Oh
17:11:22<Laevos> that doesn't sound very adventurous at all!
17:11:24<Kita> When you join, you are randomly assigned a team.
17:11:42<Laevos> Ah, okay
17:11:43<Kita> You then do your best to collect as many Steam Summer Sale cards as you can.
17:11:52<Laevos> Lilith would join, but
17:11:56<Kita> And craft the Steam Summer Sale Badge.
17:12:00<Laevos> but what if she's not on the same team as Kita Q_______Q
17:12:06<Laevos> No :'c
17:12:11<Laevos> I couldn't handle the despair
17:12:12<Kita> Kita might join, if she votes enough.
17:12:15 Laevos: shuns
17:12:19<Kita> X3
17:12:24<Laevos> (the competition, not Kita xD)
17:12:34<Kita> If you craft the badge, you earn points for your team.
17:12:47<Kita> The winning teams for each day get FREE GAMES.
17:12:54<Laevos> Hmm
17:12:59<Laevos> is there any way to make your team LOSE points?
17:13:00<Laevos> That way
17:13:03<Laevos> if we were on different teams
17:13:09<Kita> Nah.
17:13:14<Laevos> Lilith could still play Queenmaker for Kita!
17:13:15<Laevos> Awwh
17:13:17<Kita> XP
17:13:19<Laevos> what a ripoff >:c
17:13:25 Laevos: goes back to shunning it
17:13:45 Kita: rubs her ears.
17:13:51<Kita> Free games is a great incentive...
17:13:54<Laevos> that's true
17:14:00<Laevos> folks love their vidya gaymz
17:14:05<Kita> Especially since it seems like they will be popular games...

19:23:21<Laevos> Okay, Sociology homework done for the week
19:24:27<Kita> DragonForce is releasing a new album.
19:24:37<Kita> Some people are claiming it is technophobic.
19:24:51<Kita> Kita thinks that is an exaggeration.
19:25:12<Kita> They don't seem to be commenting on how things should be or shouldn't be... But on how things are.
19:26:28<Kita> We were in an airport departure lounge surrounded by TV screens, flight information screens and advertising screens. We then looked around and no one was saying a word, they were all looking at more screens on tablets, laptops and mobile phones. There's no escaping it; it's complete information overload! - Herman Li
19:26:44<Laevos> Hahahahahaha
19:26:46<Laevos> INFORMATION OVERLOAD
19:26:58<Kita> Yeah... Name of the album is Maximum Overload
19:27:14<Laevos> Oh yeah
19:27:16<Kita> And the video for DragonForce's new song really reflects that quote.
19:27:31<Laevos> Is this song "The Game"?
19:27:36<Kita> Yeah.
19:27:47<Kita> It definitely isn't DragonForce's best...
19:27:53<Kita> But it is far from their worst...
19:28:29<Kita> (Looking at you, "Valley of the Damned"... Talk about generic sounding shit? The song "Valley of the Damned" covers that.)
19:28:36<Laevos> :3
19:28:45<Kita> But this is different for DForce...
19:29:22 Kita: feels like it is a nice departure.
19:29:46<Kita> Especially after The Power Within, which was a REFRESHING take on their usual style, but not neccessarily anything NEW.
19:29:53<Kita> This? This is new. New is good, sometimes.
19:30:53<Kita> They are experimenting... And when you've been around this long, you either experiment or sell-out, and Kita guesses from Dave's (the drummer) departure, DragonForce chose to experiment, and Dave chose to go make money.
19:31:51<Kita> (The album was collaboratively written by Totman and Pruzhanov, so... Yeah. Dave probably was just told "Do that thing you do with the kickpedals and toms that you always do, but do it in a weird time signature")
19:32:41<Kita> Wait, not Pruzhanov...
19:32:50<Kita> Leclercq
19:32:58<Kita> It was Totman and Leclercq

19:40:49<Kita> Leclercq is the bassist.
19:40:56<Kita> He is more into thrash and prawg
19:41:30<Laevos> Oh okay
19:41:43<Kita> So like... It should reflect in the album...
19:41:48<Kita> and stuf.
19:41:51<Kita> stuff*
19:42:08<Kita> They also did a cover of "Ring of Fire" for the album.
19:42:09<Kita> o.o
19:43:03<Kita> Totman said in an interview that when every band member wrote down three songs and compared them all, he wrote down "Ring of Fire" as a joke, and the rest of the band loved the notion.
19:43:08<Kita> So yeah.
19:43:19<Kita> You'll get to hear that. Kita couldn't not share it.

20:27:13<Kita> Johnny Cash
20:30:03<Laevos> That sounds absolutely abysmal xD
20:30:47<Kita> Actually, given their covers of songs by Herman Li's band Shadow Warriors?
20:30:53<Kita> It promises to not be awful.
20:31:30<Laevos> Pardon my incredulity :P
20:31:58<Kita> Well, they IMPROVED all the Shadow Warriors songs they covered.
20:33:17<Laevos> I mean, one could argue that any change to a Johnny Cash song that doesn't involve it being sung by Johnny Cash is an /improvement/
20:33:21<Laevos> but that's a very relative term
20:33:27<Kita> XP
20:33:28<Laevos> still quite far off from anything approaching "good" :P
20:33:34<Laevos> or even "listenable"
20:33:46<Kita> Trent Reznor would disagree, based on how he just gave him "Hurt"
20:33:47<Kita> >>
20:33:57 Kita: still thinks Reznor's version is superior.
20:34:09<Laevos> I don't care about NIN, yo :c
20:34:23 Kita: shrugs.
20:34:34<Kita> It was more of a...
20:35:13<Kita> Kita likes electronic music, and Reznor very nicely hits that border of electronic and regular music that one could dance to...
20:35:14<Kita> Yeah.
20:35:20<Kita> Kita likes to move with her music.
20:35:23 Laevos: wiggles
20:35:58<Kita> It is kind of hard to do that silly wigglebackandforth dance to fuckin' death metal, you know?

21:08:30<Kita> It isn't a serious blog.
21:08:39<Laevos> yeah, I know
21:08:40<Laevos> but man
21:08:42<Laevos> that was so dumb
21:08:51<Kita> Like... the character he is describing is a parody of the character he pretends to be.
21:08:51<Kita> :P
21:08:57 Laevos: shakes her head
21:08:59<Laevos> Disappointed.
21:09:04<Kita> Disappointed?
21:09:09<Laevos> >:c
21:09:13 Kita: thought it was funny.
21:09:15<Kita> Humourous.
21:09:17<Kita> Silly.
21:09:26<Kita> And it describes Reddit Metal people.
21:09:38<Kita> It describes the people that refer to themselves as "Shreddit"
21:10:28<Laevos> "Genre discussions are stupid because I don't like to think" what I'm seeing here
21:10:46<Kita> Nonono...
21:10:49<Laevos> Yesyesyesyes
21:10:53<Laevos> without a shadow of a doubt.
21:11:08<Laevos> Anyway
21:11:16<Laevos> I have no real patience for parodies of metalheads like this
21:11:17<Kita> What he is pointing out about the genre descriptions... Is that the guy instigates genre debates when he has no fucking clue what he is talking about.
21:11:40<Kita> Like calling Iron Maiden power metal.
21:12:19<Laevos> I really don't. I'm a metalhead, it's all I listen to, and honestly I really glean no enjoyment or entertainment from stupid, hamfisted parody like t hat.
21:12:36<Kita> :</
21:12:38<Kita> :<*
21:13:36<Laevos> I wear band shirts, go to concerts, headbang, mosh, spend most of my disposable income on music... it's a pretty big part of my life, not something to do ironically or to poke fun at it.
21:14:04<Laevos> So I really do not, and will not ever have any interest in sites, publications, articles or individuals who do.
21:14:28<Kita> Not all parody is a labour of hate.
21:14:34<Kita> Some parodies are labours of love.
21:14:38<Laevos> Dooon't care
21:14:46<Laevos> it's never been the case that the outcome is any more tolerable
21:15:48 Kita: always found parodies by people who exist within the unit of parody to come up with more intelligent and thought out, specifically in a "true-to-form" style, parodical piece.
21:16:12<Laevos> I don't see what's funny about it x_x
21:16:17<Kita> Like... This guy obviously knows the kind of shit "trve metal fans" bitch about.
21:16:45<Laevos> I take metal seriously, would probably fall under whatever their standards of "elitist metalhead" are
21:17:05<Kita> Elitist metalheads are USUALLY genre specific.
21:17:14 Laevos: is
21:17:31<Kita> Just death, hunh?
21:17:40<Laevos> just black
21:17:52<Laevos> I listen to some death metal, but it's not really something that I'm too involved in
21:17:53<Kita> Okay. :P
21:18:25<Laevos> I think most of the death metal I listen to is from before 2000
21:18:48<Kita> Kita is more involved in Symphonic and Power, with some toe-dipping in Prog... Not a lot of obscure Prog knowledge.
21:19:12<Kita> Like... Kita knows Dream Theater...
21:19:46<Laevos> There are a lot of prog fans in #metal o:
21:20:10<Kita> Kita is more Power and Symphonic oriented.
21:20:24<Kita> Kita (used to) love her some Rooooooy Khan.
21:20:37<Kita> His voice was like butter. The closest Kita ever came to a straight crush.
21:20:38<Kita> :P
21:22:13<Kita> But then he like...
21:22:35<Kita> Found God, and became a recluse, after dealing with some drugs and mental disorders...
21:22:42<Kita> and quit Kamelot...
21:22:47<Kita> And Kita had some sad.
21:22:52<Kita> New guy is cool, though.
21:23:12<Kita> God ruins everything.
21:23:55<Kita> Has Kita ever explained to Lilith what her unmedicated delusions consist of?
21:24:10<Laevos> I'm not sure
21:24:50<Kita> So... Kita has like... full on visual-auditory hallucinations that fuel a paranoid delusion.
21:24:59<Kita> That is specifically what she is treated for.
21:25:07<Laevos> Oh, okay
21:25:28<Kita> Kita responds EXCEPTIONALLY well to medication, but has some disassociative identity things, still...
21:25:36<Laevos> Yeah :c
21:25:36<Kita> (Probably why she third persons)
21:25:45<Laevos> Fair enough, Goddess
21:25:51<Kita> Yeah... :<
21:26:07<Laevos> I need to head home... I was told a few hours ago that someone could have food delivered out here since I'm broke and have homework and all, but
21:26:16<Kita> <3
21:26:19<Laevos> they fell asleep instead, and the library is closing soon, so I'll just... go home
21:26:24<Kita> Go home, baby.
21:26:29<Kita> You'll be okay.
21:26:39<Laevos> I guess so... just still have a lot of homework and nothing to eat
21:26:45<Kita> Hey...
21:27:14<Kita> Kita looked earlier for her pre-paid cards...
21:27:24<Laevos> Kita no ;-;
21:27:26<Kita> But they were all empty. She tried.
21:27:26<Kita> :<
21:27:31 Laevos: hugs tight...
21:27:50<Laevos> I love you, Goddess... I'll figure something out
21:27:56<Kita> Okay...
21:28:00<Kita> Scrounge for change
21:28:04<Kita> In your sofa.
21:28:11<Kita> And grab some shitty fast food.
21:28:12<Kita> :<
21:28:14<Laevos> Ehh, I don't have change... don't really use cash x_x
21:28:18<Kita> :<
21:28:25<Laevos> I know
21:28:26<Laevos> silly me
21:28:33 Kita: mostly uses cash.
21:28:37<Laevos> that's fair enough
21:31:06<Laevos> Walking back to my car now
21:31:19<Laevos> there's lightning right above me
21:32:18<Laevos> the sun's no longer visible, only its afterglow remains, providing the pale twilight backdrop of the monnstrous grey monolith overhead
21:32:56<Kita> o.o
21:33:45<Laevos> the rolling giant approaches me, like Pangea's specter incarnated, washing over and reclaiming her former lands, as though to reunify them by washing them away
21:34:04 Kita: ruffles Lilith's hair.
21:34:34<Kita> Aren't you a little waxing poet?
21:34:34<Kita> :3
21:36:18<Laevos> the flashes in this bright-black sea of sky are the only stars I'll need when I drown in it, replacing my lungs' contents with that magnificent rparing wash of infinity
21:36:34<Laevos> I can't move, I want to stare at it forever
21:36:49<Kita> As pretty as it sounds...
21:37:09<Kita> Kita would encourage the appreciation of a fleeting moment to be fleeting itself.
21:37:26<Kita> To solidify the moment into enternity would cheapen its beauty, m'love.
21:37:32<Kita> eternity*
21:38:10<Laevos> what I mean is...
21:38:20<Laevos> I know exactly how I want to die
21:38:38<Laevos> fully immersed in this magnificence...
21:38:53 Kita: rubs her ears.
21:39:08<Kita> Tonight isn't your night, though. It'll come another night.
21:39:10<Laevos> I probably shouldn''t do that yet, though
21:39:16<Laevos> you're right
21:39:29<Laevos> so I'll walk away...
21:39:41 Kita: nods.
21:39:44<Kita> Good girl.
21:39:50<Laevos> there's
21:39:54<Laevos> a ferrett...
21:39:58<Laevos> or something
21:40:04<Laevos> a skunk?
21:40:25<Kita> A skunk?
21:40:30<Laevos> it looks too narrow, but I can't tell
21:40:38<Laevos> oh
21:40:43<Laevos> it's definitely one
21:40:58<Laevos> standing in the light at the bottom of a stairwell now
21:41:07<Laevos> I shouldn't get too close
21:41:09 Kita: nods.
21:41:37<Laevos> time to keep moving, I'm a little disoriented
21:41:41<Kita> They don't spray as... haphazardly as they are supposedly prone to...
21:41:45<Laevos> so I'll just keep walking
21:41:57<Laevos> oh, I meant so I don't scare it
21:42:17<Laevos> that wouldn't be very kidn of me to do
21:42:20<Kita> Scaring it would be exactly why it would spray you, hun.
21:42:22<Kita> <3
21:42:25<Laevos> kind, that is
21:43:15<Laevos> the power plant is such a mysterious building
21:43:18<Kita> Though that line of thought is adourable.
21:43:19<Laevos> it's very old
21:43:25<Kita> Oh yeah?
21:43:32<Laevos> yeah
21:43:38<Kita> It could probably use an update.
21:43:45<Kita> Is that what the construction is for?
21:43:46<Laevos> it's always running, lit, with its large doors always open
21:43:48<Laevos> no
21:43:54<Kita> Oh.
21:43:57<Laevos> the construction is on the roads
21:44:01<Kita> Awr.
21:44:07<Laevos> the main road that runs through the city
21:44:13<Laevos> it happens... about every year
21:44:23<Kita> If they did smaller sections... they could let people drive on it, and work on it at night.
21:44:23<Kita> >>
21:44:30<Laevos> in the Summer
21:44:42<Laevos> when the population is virtuallly nonexistant
21:44:48<Kita> Oh yeah. Definitely at night.
21:44:54<Laevos> being, as it is, a college town
21:44:58<Kita> Ah.
21:45:35<Laevos> I wonder if they employ a Mewtwo
21:45:44<Laevos> at the power plant
21:46:19<Kita> X3
21:46:21<Kita> A Zapdos?
21:46:46<Laevos> maybe
21:46:59<Laevos> that works too
21:47:08<Laevos> so, Kita
21:47:18<Laevos> out of all the Pokemon
21:47:31<Laevos> which would you use your masterball on?
21:47:36<Laevos> you only get one
21:49:11<Kita> Hm...
21:49:23<Kita> A mother fucking Chansey.
21:49:37<Laevos> walking down a road, pitch black but for fireflies, due to the canopy of trees overhead, it's quite creepy
21:49:41<Laevos> good choice :3
21:49:49<Kita> Because seriously
21:49:57<Kita> Fuck catching a Chansey the regular way.
21:50:20<Laevos> hehehe
21:50:53<Laevos> has Kita ever completed the National Dex in any game?
21:51:38<Kita> Yes.
21:51:47<Laevos> which?
21:52:08 Kita: has completed the national dex in every generation, except for 6th.
21:52:15<Kita> The specific games...
21:52:20<Laevos> :3
21:52:55<Laevos> Kita's the best at Pokemon ;o
21:52:58<Kita> Yellow, Crystal, Sapphire, LeafGreen, Platinum, HeartGold, White, and White 2.
21:53:05<Laevos> Nice :3
21:54:23<Laevos> Lilith's imagination is acting up
21:55:12<Kita> :3
21:55:30<Laevos> two college age folks, a guy and a girl, pull up to their driveway, get out; the guy says "well he had a wife and a daughter", starts pulling a trashcan
21:55:47<Laevos> first thought was I was going to be killed for hearing too much
21:55:58<Laevos> then I realized he actually said "has"
21:56:01<Laevos> but still
21:56:13<Laevos> silly kitty
21:56:37 Kita: rubs her chin.
21:56:38<Laevos> they wouldn't dump the body so early, or at their own house
21:56:50<Laevos> or so loudly
21:56:55<Laevos> I mean come on
21:57:02<Laevos> darpy kitty xnx
21:57:32<Kita> Ground human bones make for good gelatin.
21:57:48<Kita> And human bodies dissolve EXCELLENTLY with bleach and lye...
21:58:04<Kita> Which would be present in ASSLOADS in the drain of an old house bathtub.
21:58:21<Laevos> true
21:59:00<Laevos> lye is also used for making pretzels
21:59:35<Kita> :3
22:00:11<Laevos> I can't wait to go backk to Germany
22:00:23<Laevos> I'm going to have as many pretzels as possible
22:00:34<Kita> X3
22:00:44<Kita> Kita's bro makes pretzels and sausages.
22:00:45<Laevos> sadly I won't be in Bavaria
22:00:47<Laevos> omg
22:00:54<Laevos> I was going to ask if he did
22:00:57<Laevos> re: pretzels
22:00:57<Kita> He does.
22:01:01<Laevos> omggg
22:01:09<Kita> He does both soft, and hard...
22:01:19<Kita> And the soft ones are like...
22:01:21<Kita> The best.
22:01:22<Laevos> soft are my favorite
22:01:24<Laevos> omg
22:01:27<Laevos> I'm in love
22:01:43<Kita> He drinks beer, though.
22:01:53<Kita> Dark beers, and only with good aromatics.
22:02:11<Laevos> it's okay
22:02:42<Kita> He is VERY German.
22:02:50<Laevos> love conquers all
22:02:55<Laevos> and pretzels are love
22:02:56<Laevos> :333
22:03:08<Kita> He gets upset because... Dad wasn't very in love with his heritage?
22:04:06<Kita> And he very much is.
22:04:06<Kita> He went to go see his cousin, one year.... Came back...
22:04:06<Kita> "HOW THE FUCK DID WE NOT KNOW HOW FUCKING AWESOME GERMANY IS"
22:04:10<Kita> He was 17 at the time, and drank a lot.
22:04:18<Laevos> hehehe
22:04:34<Laevos> yeah, I can see how that might have happened
22:04:41<Laevos> that kind of divide
22:05:52<Kita> And Germany is pretty awesome.
22:05:58<Kita> They used to not be
22:06:01<Kita> But now they are.
22:06:36<Laevos> it's a nice place
22:08:22 Kita: makes a pretzel cat
22:09:15<Laevos> ouo
22:09:17<Kita> >Watching old DragonForce music video
22:09:17<Kita> >See ZP
22:09:28<Kita> >Wow... Leather pants AND decorative sideburns braids?
22:09:45<Kita> Snrk

15:13:38<Laevos> by "it" I mean Mega Man 2
15:13:53 Kita: knows.
15:13:55<Kita> Okay.
15:14:02<Kita> Now you know the basics of Mega Man.
15:14:05<Laevos> :3
15:14:09<Kita> Now try the first one.
15:14:16<Kita> X3
15:14:20<Laevos> Is it EVEN HARDER?
15:14:36<Kita> The bosses are harder.. Stages are much the same difficulty...
15:14:46<Kita> Bombman and Cutman are good first choices.
15:14:56 Laevos: noodles
15:14:58<Kita> Elecman can take you out in three shots.
15:15:14<Kita> Iceman can too, but he is easier to dodge.
15:16:33<Laevos> Hmm, okay :3

23:47:33<Laevos> Hi there :3
23:47:42<Laevos> Hehehe
23:47:46<Laevos> I was in a battle with someone
23:47:48<Laevos> and they were losing
23:47:53<Laevos> and they wanted to ragequit
23:47:53<Laevos> but
23:47:58<Laevos> instead of just leaving the room
23:48:03<Laevos> they kept typing in /forfeit
23:48:06<Laevos> which didn't work
23:48:15<Laevos> so I told them that quitting wasn't allowed
23:48:26<Kita> o.o
23:48:34<Laevos> so they stayed for the rest of the battle, only to say at the end that there used to be a command to instantly quit and update the ladder
23:48:40<Laevos> but somehow they didn't just want to... leave the room
23:48:43<Kita> XD
23:48:54<Laevos> it was silly

00:55:29<Kita> Out of all the languages Kita has ever heard...
00:55:41<Kita> Japanese is the only the one that makes Rap really sound good.
00:55:47<Kita> Like.. at all.
00:56:01<Laevos> xD
00:56:19<Kita> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbWoaRdcxLM
00:56:32<Kita> And even then, this still isn't Rap.
00:56:46<Kita> She is just rapping in like.. some casual-ass alt music.
00:58:10<Laevos> Pflflflf
00:58:21<Kita> o.o
00:58:43<Kita> Its Japanese Underground Indie shit. What do you expect?
00:59:57<Laevos> "shit" >u>
01:01:15 Kita: likes it, but also knows where it came from, understands the context, and spent like... 15 hours listening to it in her TWEWY run. (This is an exaggeration. There is actually a lot of different pieces. This one RARELY showed up in the game, at all... And not even this version.)
01:01:27<Laevos> :3
01:02:51<Kita> So zetta slow!
01:02:59<Kita> SOH-CAH-TOA...
01:03:04<Kita> IIIIIINFINITE!
01:03:08<Kita> SINE!
01:03:12<Kita> Cosine!
01:03:16<Kita> TAAAAANGENT
01:03:28<Laevos> zetta
01:03:44<Kita> These are all IN BATTLE quotes with a character named...
01:03:49<Kita> SHO MINAMIMOTO
01:03:51<Kita> AKA
01:04:00<Kita> MATHPUN WIZARD OF FUCK YOU
01:04:29<Kita> Sho... Funny character. Hell to fight against.
01:04:38<Kita> HE IS ALSO A FUCKING COWARD
01:05:18<Kita> Other memorable quotes...
01:05:31<Kita> "Attention, hollow-skulled hectopascals!"
01:06:14<Kita> "The amount of weight I'm going to let YOU 2 carry is... Take a guess." "What?" "One Yoctogram!" "Ah... That means we're on the atomic level, right?"
01:06:29<Laevos> fuck...
01:06:48<Kita> Fucking Sho.
01:06:52<Kita> o.o
01:06:52<Kita> ?
01:07:02<Laevos> I can't do this...
01:07:10<Kita> Can't do what?
01:07:27<Laevos> two days to get the syllabus and schedule for my honors thesis made
01:07:32<Laevos> or the whole project will be terminated
01:07:40 Kita: noses.
01:07:45<Kita> Don't not try, though.
01:07:56<Laevos> i just want to die
01:08:12<Kita> Hey...
01:08:27<Kita> Lilith... Don't over-react to it. Come on.
01:08:46<Laevos> it's the only thing in my undergrad career that'd mean anything at all...
01:09:59<Laevos> and I'm going to fuck it up
01:10:02<Laevos> like I fuck everything up
01:10:10<Laevos> I was stupid to think that I could actually do this...
01:10:10<Kita> Then you'll just have to hunker down and get it down.
01:10:19<Laevos> I can't plan
01:10:21<Laevos> I can't organize
01:10:23<Laevos> I can't
01:10:33<Kita> Saying you can't is why you can't.
01:10:37<Kita> Say you can, instead.
01:10:43<Laevos> then I'd be lying
01:10:45<Laevos> I'm not supposed to lie
01:10:51<Kita> You'd be motivating.
01:11:00<Kita> it isn't a lie if you get it done.
01:11:40 Kita: rubs her shoulders...
01:12:13<Kita> Whether you get it done or not... Kita's still here, sweets.
01:12:16<Kita> But do try.
01:12:23<Laevos> I just want to be dead
01:12:25<Laevos> everything is falling apart
01:12:30<Laevos> I've run out of steam
01:12:58 Kita: nuzzles...
01:13:20<Kita> Come on, hun... Freaking out like this and not doing it means your chance of success is zero.
01:13:29<Kita> At least if you try, you have a chance of success.
01:19:16<Laevos> it'll just be worse when I inevitably fail...
01:19:35<Kita> Failure is never inevitable.
01:23:54<Laevos> sure it is...
01:24:18<Laevos> there is an infinite amount greater of impossible tasks than possible ones...
01:25:04<Kita> Only if you take on impossible challenges.
01:25:19<Kita> And an impossible challenge is no challenge. It is only an exercise in masochism.
01:25:32<Kita> This here? The is possible. You are capable. Kita believes in her kitty.
01:26:33<Laevos> I brushed my teeth
01:26:33<Laevos> and
01:26:48<Laevos> the whole time I was just thinking about buying a gun and blowing my brains out
01:26:53<Laevos> and I hate guns
01:27:33<Kita> You were thinking about the method of suicide that would make you most uncomfortable, and least likely to succeed. You were entertaining the abyss, without succumbing to it.
01:27:46<Kita> As they say...
01:28:08<Laevos> living such a worthless life is worse than dying...
01:28:15<Laevos> at least my suffering would end
01:28:18<Kita> "The thought of suicide, of ending it all, gets us through our most difficult nights." or something like that.
01:28:23<Kita> Nay.
01:28:29<Kita> For death is absolute.
01:28:35<Kita> Suffering is temporary.
01:28:48<Laevos> death is inevitable, for mortals like me
01:29:06<Laevos> why go through a life of suffering and nothingness just to reach the same end?
01:29:08<Kita> Yes, but prolonging its coming benefits those in the future.
01:29:21<Kita> Your life has value.
01:29:36<Laevos> To whom?
01:29:41<Kita> To Kita.
01:29:55<Laevos> Lilith is a failure...
01:30:00<Laevos> nothing special, nothing distinctive
01:30:07<Laevos> a wretched mess of mediocrity
01:30:07<Kita> Kita is certain there are others as well... But Kita is not familiar with Lilith's friends.
01:30:12 Kita: kisses her forehead.
01:30:38<Laevos> I've done nothing with my life, and nor will I ever... I have no self-control, self-discipline, ability to work or otherwise be useful to society in any meaningful way
01:31:26<Kita> You have excessive amounts of self-control.
01:31:43<Laevos> then why couldn't I do this on time? Why haven't I gotten all my homework done?
01:31:44<Kita> You don't even drink... A commonly accepted, highly revered social activity.
01:31:49<Laevos> I'm going to fall behind and fail...
01:32:13<Kita> Quit bitching to Kita, and get it fucking done. That's a divine command.
01:32:22<Laevos> there's nothing I can do right now
01:32:25<Laevos> I'm laying down...
01:32:42<Laevos> but I'll shut up, at least
01:33:00 Kita: crosses her arms.
01:33:16<Kita> You are a creator of self-fulfilling prophecies.
01:36:44<Laevos> mew...
01:40:24<Laevos> I can't stop crying...
01:43:49<Kita> Crying isn't bade.
01:43:51<Kita> bad*
01:43:55<Kita> It is okay to cry.
01:44:32<Laevos> I just want everything to end...
01:44:42<Kita> You don't want everything to end.
01:44:49<Kita> You just want the bad parts to end.

15:32:09<Kita> Are you familiar...
15:32:13<Kita> With Slam Jams?
15:36:03<Laevos> Yes ma'ams
15:36:27 Kita: finds them hilarious.
15:36:31<Laevos> :3
15:36:40<Kita> Like... This is to laugh, because it is ridiculous.
15:36:47<Kita> This isn't to listen or critique.
15:36:54<Laevos> Yeah, I've listened to them
15:36:57<Kita> But this genuine, re-executable humour.
15:37:00<Laevos> they are pretty ridiculous, it's gr8
15:37:05<Laevos> owie
15:37:13<Laevos> I'm getting lots of cramps in my intestines
15:37:14<Kita> o.o
15:37:22<Kita> Maybe
15:37:42<Kita> You should drink A LOT of fluids, and take a fiber supplement.
15:43:17<Laevos> Might be too much fiber
15:43:21<Laevos> it's  happened to me before
15:43:25<Kita> :<
15:43:26<Laevos> and I've been having water all day Q_Q
15:43:44 Kita: tends to have cramps after her massive binges.
15:43:45<Laevos> Getting up from my desk every few minutes and going to the water fountain Dx
15:43:52 Laevos: collapses on
15:43:53<Kita> o.o;
15:44:02<Laevos> I got my schedule and syllabus all done
15:44:03<Laevos> and sent it
15:45:07<Kita> Good girl.

15:48:38<Laevos> luck was on my side
15:48:44<Laevos> my poetry class was cancelled (again)
15:48:53<Laevos> so I had more time
15:48:56<Kita> Or the blessing of your most beautiful fucking goddess.
15:48:57<Laevos> plus more time to work on the homework
15:48:59<Laevos> oh yeah
15:49:03<Laevos> that's probably what it was ^//////^
15:49:07<Laevos> Thank you, Goddess <3
15:49:07 Kita: petpats.
15:49:12<Laevos> You always protect me Q_Q
15:50:34<Kita> Minimise actual and potential suffering; maximise potential and actual happiness. In that order. Make all your decisions in accordance to this principle to the best of your ability, and Kita shall always protect her priestess.
15:50:35<Kita> <3
15:50:57 Laevos: nods! <3

16:02:45<Kita> Funny thing... Some people prefer harsh vocals... some people prefer clean... but to discredit either, in Kita's opinion, is bullshit.
16:03:03<Kita> Both take training and skill to be competent with.
16:03:15<Kita> And maybe even a little natural talent.
16:03:53<Kita> Someone with a high, squeaky voice, in most cases, shouldn't do harsh. Their larnyx probably can't handle it.
16:04:16<Kita> The guy who sounds like he breathes cigarettes PROBABLY doesn't have the range for clean vocals.
16:06:04<Laevos> :3
16:06:26<Kita> That said...
16:06:34<Kita> Doesn't mean they can't give it a shot.
16:06:52<Kita> If they suck, at least they had the balls/ovaries/whatever to try.

20:50:11<Kita> kimchee....

20:58:43<Laevos> Yep!
20:58:50<Laevos> Free if you eat it all, $20 otherwise
20:59:05<Laevos> Lilith really wants to try the ghost chili ramen, but doesn't want two servings...

15:06:17<Kita> Also, Iron Maiden gets mentioned SOOOOOO much in Power Metal circles... and its just like... "THAT IS NOT POWER METAL, YOU FUCKS."

15:08:50<Kita> If Kita knows anything about metal... It is what Power Metal sounds like.
15:10:07<Kita> Also, when people say "Inhuman Rampage" is their favourite DForce album, or that "Tinnitus Sanctus" is the best Edguy album...
15:10:38<Kita> Tinnitus Sanctus is everything that Kita DOESN'T like about Edguy and what they do, compressed and concentrated into one album.

15:17:31<Kita> They were good with that.
15:18:14<Kita> Because that as Power Metal as it is.
15:18:19<Kita> And as it should be.
15:18:40<Kita> They are trying to revive 80s Glam Rock + Modern Rap Music Sexism.

15:19:05<Laevos> :c
15:19:26<Kita> Edguy is legitimately the only Power Metal band that makes Kita angry... but they started out GREAT. They started out ICONIC of what Power Metal is...
15:19:40<Laevos> :ccc
15:19:42<Kita> And then they just... devolved into sexist, sex-obsessed, religious assholes.
15:21:16<Kita> Like... even the Nordic, Viking, let's be Eurowarriors idea that is now centric to Power Metal doesn't bother Kita as much as the mere mention of Edguy.

15:23:17<Kita> Nah. Get a really big, almost comically large pair, and rock-it with 0fucks.
15:23:29<Kita> Why? Because Functional > Stylised.
15:23:37<Laevos> I always care about my appearance though

15:27:10<Laevos> I don't like sunglasses :c
15:27:32<Kita> The only other option is a comically-brimmed hat.
15:27:48<Laevos> noooooo

01:18:45KitaFox is now known as Kita
01:18:45<Kita> :<
01:20:27<Laevos> Finally got back in the house x_x
01:20:35<Kita> How?
01:20:43<Laevos> got a person from AAA to come and force the lock on my car
01:20:52<Kita> o.o
01:20:52<Laevos> so I could get the keys out and get back inside
01:20:54<Laevos> so tired now
01:21:05 Laevos: snuggles Q_Q
01:21:18 Kita: licks.
01:22:58 Laevos: licks back and kisses all over Q_Q
01:22:59<Laevos> I love you
01:23:09<Kita> Love you, too.
01:24:00 Laevos: clings and cries on
01:24:38<Kita> :<
01:25:41<Laevos> Love you so much Q_Q can I just cling on you forever? ;~;
01:25:54 Kita: nuzzles her face
01:28:23<Kita> Want a silly anecdote?
01:28:49<Laevos> Yes ;-;
01:28:57<Kita> When Zero is introduced into the Mega Man series... EVERY BADGUY BECOMES OBSESSED WITH HIM.
01:29:14<Kita> And in the Mega Man Zero series...
01:29:20<Kita> It almost becomes sexual.
01:30:08<Laevos> ouo
01:30:40<Kita> The begin to "burn with an inner desire to defeat Zero"
01:30:58<Kita> Fighting with Zero becomes "the only thing that gives them passion"
01:31:13<Laevos> omggg ;u;
01:33:15<Kita> Yeah.
01:33:20<Kita> Zero IS a badass.
01:33:27<Kita> He gets up close and personal.
01:34:51<Laevos> :3
01:35:03<Kita> But he appears in Mega Man X.
01:35:08<Kita> So you have to wait!
01:35:08<Kita> X3
01:36:49<Laevos> Awwh! ;n;
01:36:55<Kita> Or
01:37:06<Kita> You could try Mega Man Zero on an emulator.
01:40:25<Kita> And Mega Man Zero, while still very fun and still very Mega Man...
01:40:32<Kita> Is actually totally different.

23:10:32<Laevos> Been watching Kill la Kill
23:10:50<Kita> Kill la Kill is amazing
23:10:59<Laevos> No spoilers
23:11:01<Laevos> BBY
23:11:10<Kita> You dig it?
23:11:16<Kita> They did TTGL, as well.
23:11:29<Laevos> They did FLCL too
23:11:35<Kita> Yush
23:11:45<Laevos> It's okay so far
23:11:47<Kita> And Neon Genesis Evangelion.
23:11:49<Laevos> Kill la Kill, th at is
23:11:53<Kita> GAINAX is incredible.
23:12:03<Kita> Everything they do is lined with gold.
23:12:20<Laevos> Hehehe
23:12:22<Laevos> EVEN WHEN THEY POOP
23:12:24<Laevos> HEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHE
23:12:33<Laevos> actually that sounds like it could be a bit of a health concern
23:12:38<Laevos> they should probably stop eating so much gold.
23:13:08<Kita> There is actually a company that sells you gold flakes, specifically so that can eat them, and shit gold.
23:13:14<Laevos> Yeah, I've seen those
23:13:29<Laevos> I mean whatever you're into
23:13:38<Laevos> Just seems like you'd have a pretty limited timeframe to enjoy it
23:13:56<Laevos> even if it's gold-plated, you've still gotta flush that shit
23:16:15<Kita> o.o
23:16:32<Laevos> O_O
23:16:34<Laevos> IT'S TRUE OKAY
23:16:43<Laevos> Think about it
23:17:03<Kita> Well...
23:17:05<Kita> Yeah
23:17:17<Laevos> I mean, are they expensive? 
23:17:19<Laevos> They sound like they migt be
23:17:33<Kita> Yeah
23:17:57<Laevos> Q_Q
23:18:08<Laevos> Maybe if they were something you could by for $0.50 at a party store
23:18:11<Laevos> just for giggles

23:22:12<Kita> Working on planning her Pokemon-based Punch-Out clone.
23:22:42<Laevos> OuO
23:23:04<Laevos> Pics plz
23:23:26 Kita: is only doing planning and writing

23:23:53 Laevos: licks :3

23:24:10<Kita> Nothanks
23:24:24<Laevos> Hehehe
23:24:26<Laevos> it's okay
23:25:32<Laevos> went to a thrift store earlier
23:25:42<Laevos> looked through the tapes and got an interesting one
23:25:54<Laevos> some '60s horror radio shows
23:25:58<Laevos> "Macabra"
23:26:06<Kita> o.o
23:26:15<Laevos> It's rly cheesy
23:26:34<Kita> Yeah. It is parodied a few times in Tom & Jerry.
23:26:45<Laevos> Really? O_O
23:27:05<Laevos> I never know o:
23:27:17<Kita> Yeah.
23:27:28<Laevos> err
23:27:30<Laevos> *knew
23:27:49<Kita> Okay.
23:28:15<Kita> So... Kita didn't watch TV when she was little, and she doesn't watch like... cable television.
23:28:26 Laevos: nods
23:28:29<Kita> So... Kita didn't watch Tom & Jerry until she was like... 17.
23:28:39<Kita> And her bro was like "Whaaaaat
23:28:41<Kita> "
23:28:49<Laevos> Q_Q
23:29:05<Kita> So she sat her down and watched like... 30 episodes of it with her.
23:29:10<Kita> It is a cute show...
23:29:19<Kita> But it is really 2-D.
23:29:39<Laevos> Yeah
23:29:45<Laevos> it's pretty formulaic
23:29:50<Laevos> a lot of those old cartoons were, really
23:29:57<Kita> But Kita remembers the one with the baby elephant
23:30:08<Kita> That Jerry painted to look like a mouse.
23:30:48<Kita> And that radio show was parodied in that episode, and later one, where Jerry pretends to be a ghost.
23:31:01<Kita> (Or well... a radio show like that one.)
23:31:12<Kita> So
23:31:21<Kita> What is Lilith's conclusion on Mega Man
23:31:27<Laevos> It was gr8
23:31:29<Laevos> can't wait to play more
23:31:33<Laevos> and to play X with Kita :3333
23:31:45<Kita> X3
23:31:48<Kita> Seriously?
23:31:56<Kita> You like Jump'n'Shootman?
23:31:56<Kita> :D
23:32:04<Laevos> Yep :3
23:32:05<Laevos> pew pew
23:32:53<Kita> Yay!
23:33:01<Kita> Mega Man was such a good series.
23:33:05<Laevos> :D
23:33:56<Kita> And Kita does mean was
23:34:13<Laevos> Yeah
23:34:14<Laevos> :c
23:34:25<Kita> Mega Man 1 through 10 are all good.
23:34:35<Kita> Mega Man 9 and 10 are new, and are good... but...
23:34:45<Laevos> NOT GOOD ENOUGH
23:34:50<Kita> They might be... a little... soulless?
23:35:07<Laevos> Soul of a New Machine ;-;
23:35:11<Kita> X3
23:35:23<Laevos> (That's the name of the only Fear Factory album Lilith's ever heard)
23:35:57<Kita> X3
23:36:01 Kita: snickers.
23:36:42<Laevos> Tee-hee
23:36:44<Laevos> it was okay
23:36:53<Kita> But uhhh...
23:36:56<Kita> yeah.
23:36:58<Laevos> Yeah
23:37:01<Kita> And then Mega Man X
23:37:01<Laevos> Megaman and stuff
23:37:05<Kita> Which had GREAT
23:37:08<Kita> And AWFUL.
23:37:20<Kita> Mega Man Zero... Good, but really different.
23:37:42<Kita> (Oh, the classic series also includes Mega Man and Bass, which kicked ass.)
23:37:55<Laevos> Bass
23:37:58<Laevos> o::::
23:38:18<Kita> Yeah!
23:38:21<Kita> Bass is cool.
23:38:21<Kita> :3
23:38:29<Laevos> Dat bass?
23:38:48<Kita> Yeah, that kind of bass
23:38:52<Kita> But
23:39:16<Kita> Bass and Treble were an extension of the Japanese names of the characters.
23:39:21<Kita> Mega Man was "Rock Man"
23:39:28<Kita> And Proto Man was "Blues Man"
23:39:33<Laevos> omg
23:39:38<Kita> Bass was Forte
23:39:45<Kita> and Treble was some other thing
23:39:56<Laevos> Hehehehe
23:40:15<Kita> So... Roll makes more sense, now.
23:40:19<Kita> Rock and Roll
23:40:29<Kita> And Rock became Rock Man.
23:40:41<Kita> to go fight the brainwashed Robot masters!
23:41:08<Laevos> :33333
23:42:02<Kita> So yeah
23:42:10<Kita> That should make you happy, damnit
23:42:39<Laevos> It does
23:42:40<Laevos> bbly
23:43:00 Kita: offers a pawhand
23:43:06 Laevos: takes it graciously <3
23:43:10<Kita> Oh!
23:43:13<Kita> Later games
23:44:22<Kita> You get a dog named Rush
23:44:33<Laevos> Whaaaaaaaaat
23:44:56<Kita> Yes
23:45:06<Kita> And he can do the Item-2 thing
23:45:12<Laevos> :333333333
23:45:14<Laevos> rocket dog
23:45:22<Kita> Yes
23:45:32<Kita> You can also combine with him.
23:45:36<Kita> (Rush Armour)
23:45:41<Laevos> o:::
23:48:27<Kita> Yes
23:48:31<Kita> Rush is best companion.

00:17:55<Laevos> PEW PEW PEW
00:18:02<Kita> So
00:18:10<Kita> Mega Man 3 introduces Rush.
00:18:19<Kita> And sliding!
00:18:23<Laevos> :333333
00:18:28<Kita> He does a little Slide-dash-kick thing.
00:19:15<Kita> And Mega Man 4 introduces the charge ability.
00:20:15 Laevos: makes PEW PEWPEW sounds along with the music
00:20:22<Kita> X3
00:20:28<Kita> That is one of the most fun things.
00:20:38<Laevos> It really is
00:21:28<Kita> Sliding is faster than running, but you can't shoot while you do it.
00:21:37<Laevos> Hmm...
00:21:41<Laevos> quite the tradeoff
00:21:47<Kita> Yeah.
00:21:59<Kita> Sliding also allows you to pass under smaller gaps.
00:22:22<Laevos> Oooh
00:22:48<Kita> Wanna see Rush
00:22:54<Laevos> Hmmmmmmm
00:23:00<Laevos> I should probably just earn it instead ouo
00:23:13<Kita> Nono. You get him from the start of 3.
00:23:19<Laevos> EXACTLY
00:23:23<Laevos> EARN IT BY BUYING THE GAT DANG VIDEO GAME
00:23:43<Kita> He is default.

00:25:13<Kita> http://www.megamanmonthly.com/summary/025-1.png
00:25:34<Kita> They have met a bunch of time, over the course of two story-arcs.
00:27:39<Laevos> I've read some of the Sonic ones
00:27:50<Kita> http://operationrainfall.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/smash-bros-mega-man.png
00:27:56<Kita> Rush will be in Smash Bros.
00:28:08<Laevos> as a stage>
00:28:10<Laevos> *?
00:28:12<Kita> He is so cute
00:28:13<Kita> No.
00:28:22<Laevos> ;-;
00:28:23<Kita> Rush is one of Mega Man's moves.
00:28:29<Laevos> omg ouo
00:28:34<Kita> But you will recognise that castle!

00:52:44<Laevos> I'm sure
00:53:02<Kita> No... But Woodman is made entirely of wood!
00:53:07<Laevos> True
00:54:37<Kita> Snakeman has the Search Snake, weapoN!
00:54:48<Kita> Which are tiny, little Snake Bombchus.
00:57:01<Kita> And Bombchus are mouse-shaped bombs from Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, that wiggle along the floor and go boom!
00:57:49<Kita> But his are snakes.

01:09:30<Kita> Mega Man 3...
01:09:35<Kita> Want a very, very basic hint?
01:11:07<Laevos> I'm dying a lot
01:11:14<Kita> Hardman, Topman, Shadowman, Sparkman, and Magnetman are one chain of weaknesses... Needleman, Snakeman, and Geminiman are another.
01:11:47<Kita> So... you should plan to fight two with the buster.
01:11:54<Kita> And yeah. Mega Man games are hard.
01:11:55<Kita> :<
01:12:10<Laevos> ;w;
01:12:25<Kita> Mega Man 2 had easy mode, so you could get a feel for it. Mega Man 3 doesn't have that.
01:12:30<Laevos> ya ;-;
01:13:13 Kita: would suggest Topman or Magnetman.
01:13:18<Kita> Those two are pretty easy.
01:13:41<Kita> Once you beat that chain, Needleman is a pretty good choice.
01:14:13<Kita> But DO NOT TRY TO GO AT GEMINIMAN UNTIL YOU HAVE BEATEN EVERYONE ELSE.
01:14:43<Laevos> hehehe TOO LATE
01:14:46<Laevos> BAD THINGS HAPPENED
01:14:51<Kita> D:
01:15:01<Kita> Geminiman is almost IMPOSSIBLE with the buster.
01:15:14<Laevos> uguu
01:15:29<Laevos> This one also appears to have

02:18:54<Laevos> you're so sweet, Goddess ;///////;
02:18:56 Laevos: kisses
02:19:24<Kita> You could try emulating the GBA Mega Man Zero series...
02:19:30<Kita> They are a lot easier.
02:19:41<Laevos> True xD
02:19:58<Kita> Well...
02:20:26<Kita> They play REALLY different, though.
02:20:34<Kita> Primarily, Zero is a melee attack.
02:20:38<Laevos> o_o
02:20:53<Kita> But the Z-Sabre...
02:20:56<Kita> Is awesome.

02:34:01<Kita> Visual Boy Advance is a good GBA emulator.
02:34:16<Laevos> the Z SWORD
02:34:19<Laevos> and I know it is :3
02:34:26<Kita> You use it?
02:34:27<Kita> ;3
02:34:50<Laevos> I have used it xD
02:34:58<Kita> :3
02:35:11<Kita> VBA is what Kita plays all GBA games on, now.
02:35:24<Laevos> Yay :D
02:37:14<Kita> n.n
02:38:14 Laevos: licks~
02:38:40 Kita: tastes like strawberries
02:38:54<Laevos> Yummy OuO
02:38:56 Laevos: licks again >u>
02:39:05<Kita> X3
02:39:17 Kita: tastes like lemon sorbet.
02:39:33<Laevos> O_O
02:39:40<Laevos> Color transformation!
02:39:44 Laevos: keeps licking >u>
02:40:05 Kita: rapidly changes between fruity desert flavours, and grows dizzy.
02:40:20 Laevos: stops and cuddles O_O
02:41:07<Kita> o.x
02:41:20<Laevos> Sorry Goddess Q_Q
02:41:38<Kita> It's okay
02:44:30<Laevos> You're so powerful
02:44:33<Laevos> and flavorful ;-;
02:45:03<Kita> As a deity that inspires gluttony, she would hope so.
02:45:42<Laevos> Good point... >U>
02:46:50 Kita: likes her female servants to be plump and squishy.
02:47:07 Laevos: tries to inflate herself T_T
02:47:18 Kita: rubs her ears
02:47:47 Laevos: purrs and squishifies ;-;
02:48:03 Kita: nuzzles
02:49:10 Laevos: kisses on Q_Q
02:49:40<Kita> Kita personally believes that bigger is better
02:50:13<Kita> Lilith knew this, though.
02:50:36<Laevos> Yes <3
02:50:38<Laevos> Lilith knows this
02:55:20 Kita: stretches
02:55:37<Kita> Goofox...
02:55:50 Laevos: clings to Her Divine Goofooxness
02:55:56<Kita> Actually a sentient, interconnected nanite cluster.
02:56:23<Kita> Gives her the liquid feel...
02:56:32<Kita> Organic appearance...
02:56:41<Kita> Complete control over constitution...
02:56:43<Laevos> Ooh :3
02:56:50<Kita> Actually a robotic hivemind.
02:57:07<Laevos> OuO
02:57:25<Laevos> That's pretty cool
02:57:29<Laevos> I wish I were as cool as you, Kita Q_Q
02:57:33<Kita> XP
02:57:37<Laevos> how is it already 2:52
02:57:39<Laevos> omggg
02:57:40<Kita> Nothing wrong with being a kitty.

02:58:24 Kita: nods.
02:59:08 Laevos: clings on <3
03:00:42<Kita> <3
03:00:54<Laevos> I love you so so much, Goddess <3
03:01:13 Kita: loves Lilith, too.
03:03:06<Laevos> Lilith is a lucky kitty, then! :3
03:03:22<Kita> n.n
03:04:14<Laevos> I have such an amazing Goddess ;///////;
03:05:01<Kita> <3

13:05:06<Laevos> So
13:05:14<Laevos> since waking up
13:05:22<Laevos> I've beaten Magnet Man, Top Man and Snake Man ;u;
13:06:51<Kita> :D
13:07:03<Kita> See?
13:07:10<Kita> Kita knew Lilith could do it!
13:07:10<Kita> <3
13:07:19<Laevos> Spark Man's level has cool music xux
13:07:31<Kita> All of Mega Man has cool music.
13:07:33<Kita> :P
13:07:43<Laevos> ;u;
13:08:47 Kita: feels like she peddled a drug.
13:09:10<Laevos> xux
13:09:24 Kita: snickers.
13:09:30<Kita> You got bit by the Mega Bug.
13:10:19<Laevos> Yes ma'am!
13:10:33<Kita> X3
13:15:20<Kita> Also
13:15:28<Kita> We're gonna watch this...

13:16:12<Laevos> Goo lagoon :3
13:16:20<Kita> XP
13:16:39<Laevos> Pfft lol
13:16:56<Kita> Revy is an American... And she has a foul mouth.
13:17:08<Laevos> So I see
13:17:09<Kita> She has very colourful analogies...
13:17:51<Laevos> I'm sure xux
13:17:51<Kita> And sometimes she is a liiiiittle bit racist in her nicknaming of people... But mostly because the people pissed her off, so she spends the rest of her encounters with them trying to offend them and piss them off.
13:18:22<Laevos> :cccc
13:18:23<Kita> Very much a "push your luck" kind of character.
13:18:25<Laevos> ;w;
13:18:31<Kita> She gets called out on numerous occassions.
13:19:19<Kita> There is an assassin from the Hong Kong Triad, named Shenua, who Revy calls "Chinglish"
13:20:43<Laevos> omgg
13:21:21<Kita> But Revy is one of those characters who is a product of her environment and doesn't really understand social nuances.
13:21:22<Kita> :P
13:23:00<Laevos> Hehehhe
13:23:04<Laevos> I'll be sure to watch it 
13:23:05<Laevos> WITH YOU
13:23:20<Kita> The other characters sometimes are very... surprised and apalled by her choices in words.
13:23:30<Laevos> I'll bet
13:24:20<Laevos> Guess I gotta get out there so that we can watch it ;u;
13:24:30<Kita> XP
13:24:36 Laevos: vroom vrooms away

22:14:48<Laevos> sure
22:14:56<Kita> Dwarf Racist Party Dad
22:15:01<Laevos> ;n;
22:15:31<Kita> It is a strange, racist against dwarves, frat-party stylised, Thranduil... Who embarasses Legolas constantly.
22:16:05<Kita> http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/dwarf-racist-party-dad
22:16:07<Kita> Proof.
22:16:11<Laevos> teehee
22:16:15<Laevos> I believe it
22:16:19<Kita> PROOF.
22:16:24<Laevos> :3
22:16:25 Kita: points at the link.
22:16:49 Kita: actually only like the LotR movies... The only JRR Tolkein book she ever liked was The Hobbit.
22:17:21 Kita: did read all the LotR books... Even the Simarillion... Blech.
22:17:49<Kita> The Simarillion...
22:17:56<Kita> Ever read the King James Bible?
22:18:06<Laevos> not, like
22:18:08<Laevos> all of it
22:18:24<Laevos> I did read all of the LotR books, though
22:18:27<Kita> Well. Take away the allusions to god, add elves, dwarves, rings, and talk less about Jesus...
22:18:29<Laevos> (not the Simarillion)
22:18:34<Kita> And you have The Simarillion.
22:18:38<Laevos> lol
22:18:43<Laevos> sounds boring as fuck Q_Q
22:18:55<Kita> It is really like a...
22:19:09<Kita> "Here is the history of the LotR universe. Go forth and be fucking nerds."
22:19:28<Laevos> lol
22:19:30<Kita> "Also #dwarfracistpartydad. That is all."
22:19:49<Kita> Tolkeinian fantasy is okay...
22:19:56<Kita> Kita prefers Gygaxian.

22:39:17<Kita> You could make a savory version, and use pretzel dough, and add salt.
22:39:33<Kita> Like... fill it with a peppercorn/garlic/cheese combo
22:39:40<Laevos> Or fill it with MORE DOUGH
22:39:41<Kita> Ohgodthatwouldbesogood

22:58:19<Laevos> it does suck

22:58:33 Kita: makes a Pepper Jack fondue to die for.
22:58:34<Kita> :<
22:58:40<Laevos> ;w;
22:58:54<Laevos> Okay I'll try some, Goddess ;u;
22:59:20<Kita> Is kind of, but not too, spicy...
22:59:28<Laevos> :3
22:59:35<Kita> And creamy, and cheesy, and melty, and warm...
22:59:38<Kita> Mmf.
22:59:45<Laevos> xux
22:59:53 Laevos: licks her warm Googoddess
23:00:00<Kita> white cheeses are best
23:00:05<Kita> Yellow cheeses are okay
23:00:16<Kita> But white cheeses are better to age, grate, and melt.
23:00:26<Kita> Yellow cheeses are more POWERFUL in flavour...
23:00:32<Kita> But just... so hard to USE.
23:00:41<Kita> White cheese plays nicer.
23:01:02<Laevos> What about
23:01:03<Laevos> brie? :3
23:01:14<Laevos> Tell me when you have some brie fondue
23:01:18<Kita> x3
23:01:20<Laevos> or
23:01:22<Laevos> gouda ;o;
23:01:25<Kita> Brie is alright. Difficult to fondue.
23:01:31<Laevos> I'll bet
23:01:34<Laevos> I want some smoked brie
23:01:35<Laevos> god damn it
23:01:36<Laevos> xux
23:01:40<Kita> Gouda is also good! Less difficult to fondue.
23:01:44<Laevos> :3
23:01:50<Laevos> Smoked gouda every day
23:02:09<Laevos> Much less illegal here than smoked weed every day >u>
23:02:29<Kita> Smoking weed is gross.
23:02:31<Kita> :<
23:02:38<Kita> Vaping it is better.
23:02:40<Kita> Less gross.
23:03:19<Laevos> Hehehe
23:03:19<Laevos> yeah
23:03:22<Laevos> that might be
23:03:26<Kita> Improperly crafted oils leave resin in the pipes...
23:03:31<Laevos> BUT
23:03:37<Kita> So... there is still some gross.
23:03:40<Laevos> is there a song that goes "vape weed every day"?
23:03:43<Laevos> IS THERE?
23:03:47<Kita> No, but that song is old
23:03:49<Kita> and tired
23:03:57<Laevos> be that as it may ;u;
23:04:00<Kita> And a poor representation of marijuana users.
23:04:11<Kita> Kita is a very calm user.
23:04:12<Laevos> probzably
23:04:14<Laevos> but like
23:04:18<Laevos> mixed with Kirby music and stuff
23:04:22<Kita> She takes her hit, doesn't look or sound gross...
23:04:29<Laevos> :3
23:04:39<Kita> Coughs a little bit, and then passes the bong.
23:04:41<Laevos> Kita's the complete opposite of the very concept of gross.
23:05:07<Kita> Some people are very unattractive when they take a hit.
23:05:13<Laevos> :c
23:05:18<Kita> Their face contorts, they make noises...
23:05:29<Kita> And it is always an act.
23:05:47<Laevos> ;n;
23:05:55<Kita> "I know you don't do that fucking gross face and wet hacking in private, you fuck."
23:06:11<Laevos> *coughcoughsneezecough*
23:06:32<Kita> And Kita only coughs when the bong has been passed around a few times, and the water has warmed up.
23:06:53<Kita> And Kita doesn't really vape in groups, anymore.
23:07:17 Laevos: nods
23:07:51<Kita> So she puts cold water in, drops some ice cubes in, puts the screen in, packs the bowl, aerates the weed with a pick, lights, pulls, exhales.
23:08:17<Laevos> very classy
23:08:42 Kita: also uses a grinder, so the cinders wick downwards, unlike a lot of other people, who just pack the buds....
23:08:48<Kita> Packing the bud WORKS...
23:08:51<Kita> But it..
23:09:08<Kita> The cinders don't wick like they should.
23:09:44<Kita> And Kita always cleans after she uses it.
23:09:53<Kita> So like...
23:10:06<Kita> There is no safer, more pleasant vaper to try this stuff with.
23:10:22<Kita> Just..
23:10:23<Laevos> ;w;
23:10:34<Kita> If you wanna try... Gotta commit.
23:10:42<Kita> Two sessions.
23:11:01<Kita> First one is a half, second one is a full.
23:11:21<Laevos> I have absolutely zero interest in trying xux
23:11:31 Kita: shrugs.
23:11:45<Kita> Did you ever hang out with not-obnoxious high people?
23:12:02<Laevos> Yeah
23:12:02<Kita> Aside from Kita.
23:12:03<Kita> :P
23:12:16<Kita> Who is stoned out of her gourd, right now, and you'd never know.
23:12:28<Laevos> That's fine ;u;
23:13:15 Kita: has a beautiful piece, by the way.
23:14:22<Kita> So... It is a 4-chamber bong.
23:15:03<Kita> Smoke is in the water 4 times, before it comes to the mouth piece.
23:15:40 Laevos: nods o~o
23:15:55<Kita> Very clean, fresh hits.
23:16:03<Kita> No coughing.
23:16:14<Kita> Two first timers were spoiled with Kita's piece.

14:00:14<Laevos> "Another example of a popular and developing genre of Internet folklore comes from “creepypastas,” or short horror stories, often paired with a corroborating image or two, that are shared with the intent of gleefully creeping out readers. Here again, many of the stories and visuals echo expressive genres and patterns found in oral traditions, only this time they’ve made it to the digital
14:00:14<Laevos> realm. I think this powerfully speaks to the medium’s adaptive capabilities when it comes to contemporary folklore."
14:00:39<Laevos> Reading about creepypasta on the Library of Congress website
14:00:41<Laevos> Hehehehehe
14:01:02<Kita> Pfff.
14:01:09<Kita> Creepypasta
14:01:14<Laevos> Yeah
14:01:15<Laevos> it's stilly
14:01:21<Laevos> but that still kind of makes me smile ;u;
14:01:34<Kita> Horror writing that is either too short or too shitty to be a movie script or novel.
14:01:41<Kita> Boom.
14:01:49<Kita> Much more concise definition.

21:06:44<Laevos> Very xux
21:07:07<Kita> IS KITA ULTROS
21:07:09<Kita> NO
21:07:11<Kita> BECAUSE
21:07:16<Kita> SHE ISN'T AN OCTOPUS
21:07:56<Kita> "Yeowch! Seafood isn't on the menu!"
21:09:15<Laevos> HEHEHEHE O_O
21:09:21<Kita> FFVI.
21:09:27<Kita> The octopus boss
21:09:29<Kita> Ultros.
21:09:47<Kita> When you cast Fire on him... He says that seafood line
21:09:52<Kita> And actually...
21:09:56<Kita> It is "seafood soup"
21:10:30<Kita> He does treat female party members with KO priority...
21:10:40<Kita> But that is really him targeting magic users.
21:10:55<Laevos> Oh okay xD
21:11:04<Laevos> still xux
21:11:24<Kita> Yeah. The Esper and the Runic are the only magic users...
21:11:30<Kita> And they work differently.
21:11:44<Kita> But Ultros is weak against Fire magic...
21:11:45<Kita> So...
21:11:52<Kita> He targets the casters.
21:12:01<Kita> But it is totally a tentacle porn joke.
21:12:46<Laevos> it really is xD
21:13:10<Kita> Also
21:13:17<Kita> Aura Cannon is Sabin's best move
21:13:38<Kita> It is performed by entering the Hadouken command when you pick his special command.
21:13:58<Kita> Down to right, A button.
21:14:13<Kita> Why is this important?
21:14:23<Kita> He is the first character to get access to HOLY DAMAGE
21:14:36<Kita> Though
21:14:41<Kita> He can SUPLEX A TRAIN
21:15:07<Kita> HRRRRRRROOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUGH.
21:16:10<Kita> "Uhhh... Master Sabin... I do believe you just... suplexed a train, sire. How did you... how did you do that?"
21:16:41<Kita> "Not just any train, A MOTHERFUCKING GHOST TRAIN. HOYEAH."
21:16:55<Kita> "Yes, quite. How, if I may ask?"
21:17:58<Kita> "Later, I think I will Suplex the god of all magic."
21:18:20<Kita> "You're not answering my question, master Sabin..."
21:18:32<Kita> "LET'S GO PUNCH ANIMALS."
21:20:47<Laevos> what o_o
21:22:52<Kita> Kita's summation of part of Final Fantasy VI.
21:23:12<Kita> Yes, by the time you get to the Ghost Train, you PROBABLY have the MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE Aura Cannon...
21:23:15<Kita> But come on
21:23:27<Kita> How often do you get to SUPLEX A MOTHER FUCKING TRAIN.
21:27:32<Laevos> Oh okay
21:27:40<Laevos> I've never played FFIV
21:27:42<Laevos> err
21:27:44<Laevos> VI
21:27:45<Kita> VI
21:27:50<Kita> :<
21:27:57<Kita> FFVI is the BEST ONE.
21:28:07<Kita> Hands down.
21:28:28<Kita> Some people say 1, a lot of people say 7, stupid people say 11 or 14...
21:28:34<Kita> But in reality
21:28:36<Kita> 6 is the best
21:29:14<Kita> (Kita prefers playing X, because VI still has a FUCKING GOD DAMNED STUPID SUNUVABITCH ATB SYSTEMS GRAAAAAAAH)
21:29:23<Kita> But aside from that one complaint...
21:29:29<Laevos> woah dawg
21:29:31<Kita> 6 does everything it wants to.
21:29:35<Laevos> :3
21:29:56<Kita> 6 has a huge cast of characters... And they all are awesome in their own way.
21:30:08<Kita> Sabin suplexes trains.
21:30:16<Kita> Kefka is INSANE. HOOHOOHOO~!
21:30:28<Kita> The King has a motherfucking CHAINSAW
21:30:56<Kita> He is also the best attempt at a "suave, wealthy man that people like"
21:31:03<Kita> Because he is actually likable.
21:31:08<Kita> And he is suave.
21:31:24<Kita> They wrote him very, very well.
21:31:57<Kita> Your treasure hunter, while not the best fighter, has unique, kind of gimmicky sidequests where he steals people's clothes.
21:31:57<Kita> :3
21:32:44<Laevos> That's kinda cool :D
21:32:51<Kita> Yeah.
21:33:02<Kita> FFVI is easily emulatable, and had a GBA release...
21:33:04<Kita> So..
21:33:13<Kita> List. Are you keeping a list?
21:33:13<Kita> :P
21:33:30<Kita> You missed out on so many good games.
21:33:35<Kita> And Kita loves sharing.
21:33:43<Kita> And Lilith appreciates Kita's sharing.
21:34:03<Kita> And maybe she is sparking an affection of games in Lilith.
21:34:05<Kita> Maybe.
21:34:06<Kita> :3
21:36:16<Laevos> Maybe ;3
21:36:18 Laevos: licks
21:36:28<Laevos> Lilith appreciates Kita!
21:36:33<Kita> Okay
21:36:57<Kita> When Kita and Lilith do that Mega Man X marathon...
21:37:30<Kita> Play the bad games, or have Kita summarise them... and... which version of Mega Man X1? Mega Man X, or Mega Man Maverick Hunter X?
21:38:05<Laevos> Hmm...
21:38:11<Laevos> good question @_@
21:38:56<Kita> Kita will gladly play the bad games... Except 7... 7 will, once again, be a test of Kita's patience. XP
21:39:03<Laevos> Awwh, okay xD
21:39:17<Kita> But she will still play with Lilith.
21:39:17<Kita> :3
21:39:39<Kita> And, Lilith will be playing all of them, alongside Kita, except for six.
21:39:43<Kita> Kita will play six.
21:39:49<Kita> Six is...
21:40:06<Kita> There is Mega Man and Bass. That is the hardest Mega Man game there is...
21:40:17<Kita> And right behind it, just barely, is Mega Man X6.
21:40:19<Laevos> ;n;
21:40:37<Kita> And that wouldn't be fair to Lilith.
21:40:39<Kita> ;.;
21:40:57<Kita> Kita has no-deathed EVERY Mega Man game...
21:41:01<Kita> Except for X6.
21:41:16<Kita> Because X6 requires a death.
21:41:18<Kita> T^T
21:41:37<Laevos> It does? ;n;
21:41:45<Kita> Yeah.
21:41:56<Kita> For full completion, you HAVE to die, one time.
21:44:15<Laevos> Oh okay
21:45:26<Kita> No. You can't beat Mega Man X6 without dying, because it is so hard in such unfair ways that you shoot yourself.
21:46:39<Laevos> oh no ;n;
21:46:47<Kita> XP
21:49:55<Laevos> I can't wait to play games with Kita :'3
21:50:01<Kita> X3
21:51:24<Laevos> I can't ;n;
21:51:36 Kita: snickers
21:53:06<Laevos> we can hang out and play video game and fall asleep ;u;
21:53:14<Laevos> and I can cook for my Goddess TuT
21:53:21<Kita> Ohhhh
21:53:29<Kita> That's a pretty big statement.
21:54:22<Kita> That implies that you are a good enough cook that Kita would let the drop in food quality not outweigh the loss of effort required to eat.
21:54:22<Kita> :P
21:54:31<Kita> Because Kita is THE BEST cook.
21:55:52<Laevos> Fair enough ;n;
21:57:25<Kita> That said
21:57:38<Kita> If Lilith thinks she is good enough, she can give it a shot.
21:57:40<Kita> <3
21:58:43<Laevos> I'll do my best ;n;
21:58:47<Laevos> but be honest
21:58:53<Laevos> if I'm not good enough
21:59:01<Laevos> then I wanna get better
21:59:04<Kita> Kita is a food elitist.
21:59:18<Kita> You've no fear of being told the truth.
21:59:19<Kita> :P
21:59:28 Kita: wants Lilith to be good enough.
21:59:28<Kita> <3
21:59:45<Laevos> Okay good!
22:00:16 Kita: really does mean this all in the nicest way possible.
22:00:27<Kita> n.n;;
22:01:38<Laevos> I understand! :'3
22:02:07 Kita: is picky and finicky about food.
22:02:36<Kita> Like...No cheese product... Only actual cheese.
22:02:50<Kita> Which means absolutely NO American cheese.
22:02:51<Kita> None.
22:03:05<Laevos> I hate American "cheese" :3
22:03:13<Kita> It isn't even cheese.
22:03:15 Laevos: purrs agreeably :3
22:03:16<Kita> It is plastic.
22:03:16<Laevos> it's not
22:03:25<Laevos> "cheese product"
22:03:53<Kita> No ketchup/catsup...
22:04:01<Kita> Tomato paste.
22:04:02<Laevos> I hate those, too!
22:04:06<Laevos> Ketchup, I mean
22:04:10<Kita> Yeah.
22:04:24<Kita> Every instance that people use ketchup, tomato paste would suit just fine.
22:04:40<Kita> Tomato paste + some spices.
22:04:59<Kita> And like...
22:04:59<Kita> Ketchup has a strange texture.
22:05:09 Laevos: nods
22:05:14<Laevos> it's a weirdo thing
22:05:24<Kita> No commercially made mustard.
22:05:29<Kita> Only homemade mustard.
22:05:40<Kita> Bro makes some.
22:05:47<Kita> (Of course the German makes mustard. :P)
22:06:22<Laevos> I've done homemade mustard
22:06:48 Kita: does homemade sodas.
22:06:57<Kita> |3

00:31:46<Kita> He is like...
00:31:53<Kita> A decent actor...
00:32:03<Kita> But as a person, he seems to be an ass.
00:32:14<Kita> And every time Kita sees him, she laughs.
00:32:18<Kita> Like..
00:32:24<Kita> "How are you for real, dude?"

00:48:43<Kita> Kita has a hard time accepting that people that are assholes can have talent.
00:49:17<Kita> Most people have a hard time accepting that people with talent can be assholes.
00:49:22<Kita> This is the reverse of that.
00:49:32<Kita> Instead "He can't be an asshole, he has talent."
00:49:46<Kita> It is "He is an asshole. Why does he have talent?"
00:50:15 Laevos: nods
00:50:29<Kita> And like...
00:50:34<Kita> George Clooney isn't bad.
00:50:38<Kita> He isn't the best.
00:50:58<Kita> But he hits that sweet spot of not outclassing everyone worse than him.
00:51:54<Kita> So like... He fits in a lot of movies, and that is fine.
00:52:08<Kita> He is a fucking asshole in real life, from what Kita has seen.
00:52:13<Laevos> ;n;

02:45:02<Laevos> sounds too scary ;-;

02:50:44<Kita> Here is why his opinion is controversial.
02:50:55<Kita> For a lot of people...
02:51:02<Kita> A lot of long time Zelda fans...
02:51:10<Kita> Ocarina of Time was their first Zelda game.
02:51:17<Kita> And Ocarina of Time is a good game.
02:51:23<Kita> It is NOT the best Zelda game.
02:51:27<Laevos> o::::
02:51:30<Laevos> My first was the first one
02:51:34<Laevos> and
02:51:35<Kita> But it is a good game.
02:51:41<Laevos> that's the only Zelda game I've ever finished :3
02:51:44<Kita> X3
02:51:44<Laevos> or played, really
02:52:06<Kita> For the people who don't mindlessly parrot "OOT. OOT IS BEST YES. OOT."
02:52:22<Kita> There are three choices they TEND to migrate towards...
02:52:37<Kita> A Link to the Past, Majora's Mask, and A Link Between Worlds.
02:56:44<Kita> That video kind of explains why..
02:57:14<Laevos> ;n;
02:58:11<Kita> But he makes zero mention of Majora's Mask.
02:58:11<Kita> Why is that?
02:58:11<Kita> Majora's Mask is becoming exceedingly rare.
02:58:11<Kita> And the game is horribly inaccessible.
02:58:11<Kita> Fucking hard.
02:58:51<Laevos> Aww :c
02:59:10<Kita> Poozzzles
02:59:20<Kita> Well
02:59:22<Kita> Puzzles.
02:59:25<Kita> Good puzzles.
02:59:28<Kita> Hard puzzles.
03:01:07<Kita> a lot of time management

12:53:03 Kita: blows bubbles at.
12:53:14 Laevos: jumps at them, kittylike ouo
12:53:27<Laevos> I want a WiiU now ;n;
12:53:32<Laevos> Shovel Knight is painful on the 3DS
12:53:34 Kita: snrks.
12:53:45<Laevos> IT HURTS ME, KITA
12:53:58<Kita> You get used to it, as you develop the muscles.
12:54:31<Laevos> I mean the d-pad
12:54:32<Laevos> it's too
12:54:33<Laevos> like
12:54:36<Laevos> stiff ;-;
12:54:44<Kita> Use the circle pad.
12:54:45<Kita> X3
12:54:50<Laevos> Oh god no O_O
12:55:02<Laevos> No way I can use an analog stick for a side-scrolling platformer
12:58:58 Kita: does it all the time.
12:58:59<Kita> <3
12:59:15<Kita> As long as up doesn't equal jump, you're fine.
13:02:03<Laevos> Maybe for youuuuuuuuuuUUUuUuuuuUuu ;w;
13:02:25<Kita> Depending on the model...
13:02:38<Kita> You have to play Maverick Hunter X with a stick.
13:02:52<Kita> Because some PSPs don't have pads.
13:03:03<Laevos> I'm not gonna buy a PSP ;n;
13:03:09<Kita> Kita has one.
13:03:14<Kita> PSP has good games.
13:03:19<Kita> Not as many as the DS models.
13:03:26<Kita> They have way more good games.
13:03:32<Kita> They have Mega Man ZX.
13:03:42<Laevos> :3333
13:04:01<Laevos> Mega Man XXX: The Yaoi Doujin
13:04:12<Kita> Both Mega Man Classic AND Mega Man X were re-made on the PSP.
13:04:20<Laevos> Cool :3
13:04:32<Kita> Mega Man: Powered Up! and Mega Man Maverick Hunter X.
13:04:49<Kita> In powered up, you can plays AS THE ROBOT MASTERS
13:04:53<Kita> Which includes
13:04:53<Laevos> O_O
13:04:54<Kita> TIME MAN
13:04:56<Kita> AND
13:04:57<Kita> OIL MAN
13:04:58<Laevos> O_________O
13:05:02<Laevos> That sounds cool :D
13:05:12<Laevos> Get eqiup with
13:05:12<Kita> It was very cool.
13:05:15<Laevos> - T - TIME
13:05:28<Kita> So like...
13:05:39<Kita> The original Mega Man only had 6 Robot Masters.
13:05:50<Kita> Guts, Cut, Bomb, Ice, Fire, and Elec Man.
13:05:58<Kita> And...
13:06:04<Kita> If Kita remembers correctly...
13:06:13<Kita> The weakness order was...
13:06:57<Kita> Bomb -> Guts, Guts -> Cut, Cut -> Elec, Elec -> Ice, Ice -> Fire, Fire -> Bomb.
13:07:23<Kita> And when they added Oil and Time man...
13:07:49<Kita> It fuckered everything.
13:07:50<Kita> ;.;
13:07:53<Laevos> ;n;
13:08:06<Kita> Oil Man had to be weak to Fire Man.
13:08:34<Kita> And instead of just inserting them into the loop, they messed with the loop.
13:08:45<Laevos> Q_Q
13:08:45<Kita> Bomb Man became weak to Cut Man.
13:09:16<Kita> And Oil Man was good against Elec Man.
13:11:40<Laevos> Weird ;-;

16:10:26<Laevos> Yeah :D
16:10:41<Laevos> I love how they resize him in different shots so he constantly looks enormous no matter what the setting :D
16:10:56<Laevos> and sometimes they'll just make him bigger in each shot xD

21:53:58<Laevos> Good!
21:54:06<Kita> Hey
21:54:07<Kita> Hey.
21:54:10<Kita> This show
21:54:11<Kita> Is like
21:54:17<Kita> Feminism in animu form.
21:54:29<Laevos> Ugu~u
21:54:32<Laevos> Also!
21:54:41<Laevos> Went to the library
21:54:44<Laevos> got an anime
21:54:50<Laevos> Serial Experiments: Lain
21:54:50<Kita> Which one!
21:54:53<Kita> o.o
21:54:58<Kita> Never heard of it.
21:55:08<Laevos> It's older
21:55:16<Laevos> 90s or thereabouts
21:55:22<Laevos> seems neat
21:55:23<Kita> Still...
21:55:27<Laevos> but it's very slow-paced
21:55:30 Kita: normally hears about them.
21:55:36<Kita> Oh. Yeah...
21:55:43<Kita> Slow pace shows are tough, sometimes.
21:55:45<Laevos> which I like
21:55:53<Kita> Rurouni Kenshin suffered from its slow pacing.
21:56:40<Laevos> Yeah but
21:56:47<Laevos> wasn't it trying to be an action show?
21:56:51<Kita> Well...
21:56:53<Kita> Kind of?
21:56:54 Laevos: never saw Rurouni Kenshin
21:57:18<Kita> But it really suffered from a lack of finesse and lack of artistic emphasis, ALONG with the slow pacing
21:57:27<Kita> Finesse, artistic emphasis...
21:57:32<Kita> Those help slow shows.
21:57:37<Laevos> Yeah, it needs to be focused if it's slow
21:57:40<Laevos> not just...
21:57:41<Laevos> PLODDING
21:57:52 Kita: nods.
21:57:57<Kita> OH MAN
21:58:19<Kita> GAMAGOORI IRA vs MATOI RYOOKU

21:58:46<Kita> You've seen Ep ten, yeah?
21:58:50<Laevos> Yes
21:58:57<Laevos> but not past their fight
21:59:02 Kita: only has up to ep 10 downloaded, and this is ep 9.

01:07:25<Laevos> What do I know?
01:07:35<Kita> If you don't plan on having people over...
01:07:42<Laevos> (I might)
01:07:43<Kita> Go super minimalistic.
01:07:55<Laevos> Like? ;w;
01:08:35<Kita> Kivaya, Kita's bro, once lived in a place where all he had was a comfortable matress in the corner, some bedding, and three pans in his kitchen.
01:08:48<Kita> In fact, he still goes there occassionally.
01:09:00<Laevos> I'm going to go through my stuff and see what can be
01:09:01<Laevos> discarded
01:09:03<Laevos> replaced
01:09:03<Laevos> etc.
01:09:08<Kita> It's in SoCal. He does business there, from time to time.
01:09:11<Laevos> ooh
01:09:55<Kita> A big pot, a little pot, and skillet pan.
01:10:02<Kita> Kita asked why he had two pots...
01:10:06<Kita> His answer...
01:10:19<Kita> "I really like noodles."
01:11:11 Kita: guesses he cooks noodles in the big pot, and uses the little one for stuff like rice or beans.
01:12:45<Laevos> That makes sense
01:12:49<Laevos> I probably won't have too much stuff like that
01:12:50<Laevos> really
01:13:21 Kita: snickers.
01:14:11<Laevos> I do like to cook

01:57:30<Kita> She clashes, really badly, with the rest of the cast...
01:57:40<Kita> And does it in a bad way, unlike Mako.
01:57:54<Kita> Who.. clashes with the cast in an almost "foil" way.

02:04:15<Kita> Uhhh...
02:04:30<Kita> Because it targets a thing that doesn't actually exist.

00:34:25<Laevos> I didn't ;-;
00:34:33<Kita> Good girl.
00:34:41 Kita: rubs on her jaw.
00:35:04 Laevos: purrs and collapses
00:35:08<Laevos> feeling really alone
00:35:26<Kita> You have Kita and Shovel Knight.
00:35:34<Kita> We can be your friends, tonight.
00:35:38 Kita: kisses her cheek.
00:35:59<Laevos> I actually...
00:36:03<Laevos> don't have Shovel Knight here
00:36:07<Laevos> I left it at the other house;-;
00:36:12<Kita> Awr. That's okay.
00:36:17<Kita> You got Kita.
00:36:17<Laevos> Kita is my friend, too
00:36:27<Laevos> I just...
00:36:32<Laevos> get really depressed being on my computer
00:36:50<Kita> Then you should watch silly, funny things on it.
00:39:02<Laevos> instead of listening to slightly morose, somber things on it?
00:39:07<Laevos> mrgh...
00:39:11<Laevos> it'll overheat if I watch Netflix
00:39:16<Laevos> and then I won't even have Kita to talk to
00:45:03 Kita: kisses her nose.
00:45:37<Kita> Wanna talk about a happy thing?
00:45:42 Laevos: snuggles up against
00:45:46<Laevos> like? -;-;
00:45:48<Kita> Or would you prefer to be somber and morose?
00:46:00<Laevos> ;-;
00:46:17 Kita: rubs on her ears and wraps a tail around Lilith's...
00:47:08<Kita> Keiji Inafune, the man who pretty much made the entire Mega Man series, and a good portion of his team, are working on Mighty No. 9.
00:47:17<Kita> It is a spiritual successor to Mega Man.
00:47:56 Kita: is gonna pull up some of the dev vids, if she can find them.
00:48:04<Laevos> Ooh
00:50:12<Kita> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1iEFfOBP1o
00:52:21<Laevos> let's see
00:53:31<Laevos> looks quite Mega Man
00:53:39<Kita> Yeah.
00:53:54<Kita> Mighty No. 9 is just going to be incredible.

01:03:20<Laevos> Yep :3
01:03:21<Kita> You'll probably like Mighty No. 9.
01:03:42<Laevos> I just might! <3
01:03:45<Laevos> Ughgh ;-;
01:03:49<Laevos> can I come over, Goddess?
01:04:35 Kita: kisses her forehead.
01:04:45<Kita> Kita isn't quite ready to make that jump, yet.
01:04:49<Kita> x.o;;
01:04:52 Laevos: nods and curls up
01:05:03<Kita> Eventually, though.
01:05:20<Laevos> if it's something I'm doing wrong... I'm sorry
01:05:27<Kita> No.
01:05:34<Kita> It is Kita's paranoia.
01:05:43<Kita> Kita has a bad habit of hurting the things close to her.
01:06:32<Kita> Look... Kita has known TrueWolves for like.. 3 years.
01:06:42<Kita> Kita still hasn't invited Truey over.
01:07:34<Laevos> so probably at least longer than that, yes?
01:07:49<Kita> Kita is unsure.
01:07:50<Kita> :<
01:08:00<Kita> Kita has a bubble.
01:08:12<Kita> This bubble is Kita's safe place.
01:08:39<Kita> When someone or Kita does things in this space that make Kita not feel safe...
01:08:48<Kita> It takes time for Kita to recover.
01:08:51<Kita> A lot of time.
01:08:53<Kita> Months.
01:09:21<Kita> Like... Curled up in corners, not eating, not talking, not playing games...
01:09:28<Kita> To recover from that state.
01:10:04<Kita> As a result?
01:10:17<Kita> Kita doesn't like people in it.
01:10:27<Kita> It is a Kita problem. Not a Lilith problem.
01:10:29<Kita> Promise.
01:12:30<Laevos> I believe you... and you deserve to feel safe and comfortable, Goddess...
01:12:41<Kita> So does Lilith.
01:12:42<Laevos> even if you never want to see me in person, I'll still be yours...
01:12:53 Kita: rubrubs her nosey.
01:13:02<Laevos> though I can't pretend that I wouldn't be sad if that were the case...
01:14:10 Kita: nibbles on Lilith's ear.
01:15:04 Laevos: mewls softly
01:15:36 Kita: giggles.
01:15:46<Kita> Kita prefers imperfections to perfection.
01:15:50<Kita> Perfection is boring.
01:15:58<Kita> Imperfections are interesting.
01:16:06<Kita> Imperfect is the state Kita prefers.
01:16:25<Laevos> Lilith is definitely imperfect <3
01:18:01<Kita> Which means Lilith is interesting.
01:18:09<Kita> And she has room for improvement and growth.
01:20:50<Laevos> that's good, I suppose...
01:21:40<Kita> Having the room for it is good, because Lilith has the power to obtain it.
01:21:50<Kita> Yes, yes, she does.
01:21:56 Kita: hugs tight and nuzzles on.
01:23:24 Laevos: leans against, sighing deeply
01:23:34<Laevos> Glad you believe in me, Goddess
01:23:40<Laevos> at least someone does...

01:30:13<Kita> Does Lilith prefer Sweet or Savory?
01:30:27<Laevos> savory, I suppose
01:31:02<Kita> So like... garlic and herbacious spices, and salt, and pepper, and cheese, and the like?
01:31:12<Laevos> sometimes
01:31:21<Laevos> sometimes not
01:31:27 Kita: nods.
01:31:32<Laevos> not really too big on food in general @_@
01:31:37<Kita> Does Lilith like fancy cheeses?
01:31:48<Laevos> Some~
01:32:48<Kita> Aged white cheddar, churned with mild peppers and sage flakes?
01:32:56<Laevos> never tried it
01:33:03<Laevos> sounds like it'd be fine, t hough
01:33:06<Kita> Ooo~
01:33:13<Kita> It is one of Kita's favourites!
01:33:14<Kita> <3
01:33:34<Kita> Oregon is wine country, and where there is wine, there is also cheese.
01:34:26 Kita: doesn't really care for wine...
01:34:29<Kita> But...
01:34:36<Kita> Kita lurrrrrves cheese.
01:34:48 Kita: nestles against Lilith.
01:34:53<Laevos> Good <3
01:34:59 Laevos: cuddles on
01:38:24<Kita> Know what else Kita loves?
01:38:39<Laevos> What else?
01:38:44<Kita> Kitties
01:38:47<Kita> And Wolves.
01:39:18<Laevos> Yay ;u;
01:39:20 Kita: thinks kittygirls are better for cuddling, because softer fur.
01:39:33<Kita> But Kita finds them wolfgirls to be quite, quite sexy.
01:40:00<Laevos> <3~ Lilith can be cuddly for you, then
01:42:30 Kita: scritches on Lilith's tummy.
01:42:52 Laevos: stretches out...
01:43:16<Kita> Hi, babe
01:43:34<Laevos> Lilith labors under no delusion that she stands much of a chance of being in any way sexy for her Goddess, so she wants to be useful to her in whatever way she can... <3
01:44:13<Kita> At least Lilith is aware of Kita's preference in sexual partners.
01:44:40 Kita: is very certain she could hook Lilith up with some wonderful times.
01:44:40 Laevos: nods
01:44:41<Kita> XP

01:52:27<Kita> An active libido is no issue.
01:52:45<Kita> Really. There are solutions to such an issue.
01:53:38<Laevos> Oh?
01:54:28 Kita: nods.
01:55:45<Laevos> Like what, Goddess?
01:55:53 Kita: has quite a few acquaintances that would be far more than willing to accept the duty of pleasing the High Priestess.
01:59:57 Kita: plays with Lilith's hair..
02:00:30<Kita> Though, on the gender spectrum, they are limited.

03:11:43<Kita> Fraternity is bullshit.
03:11:49<Laevos> Yes
03:11:58<Kita> Fraternity isn't real. You make it real by being a sexist prick.

03:13:02<Kita> Not because of conspiracy...
03:13:10<Kita> Because of the basis of their relationship.
03:13:19<Kita> It is inherently sexist and exclusive.

03:08:00<Kita> It is scary when they are OMGLOOKATME
03:10:12<Laevos> yeah ;-;
03:10:15<Laevos> I don't want to sex that
03:10:17<Laevos> sry ;-;
03:10:45<Kita> Heh.
03:10:51<Kita> Kivaya isn't so bad...
03:10:55<Kita> Just.. He is a guy.
03:11:17<Laevos> I'm sure he's great!
03:11:21<Kita> He doesn't have like... Mr. Olympia (ew. just ew.) going on.
03:11:27<Laevos> (That is very ew)
03:11:38<Kita> He just is fit. He isn't MUSCLY.
03:11:48<Kita> He DID punch an elk when drunk once.
03:11:55<Laevos> I'm sure he's very pretty ~u~
03:11:57<Laevos> and you've told me xD
03:11:58<Kita> And it didn't get back up.
03:12:17<Kita> So he dragged it home and Kita and Kivaya butchered it.
03:12:22<Laevos> Delicious
03:12:23<Laevos> ?
03:12:28<Kita> And ate it, over the course of like two years.
03:12:31<Kita> Yeah!
03:12:32<Laevos> omg
03:12:35<Kita> It is a gamey...
03:12:37<Kita> But it is good.
03:12:38<Laevos> how do you keep meat for two years?
03:12:47<Kita> A good freezer...?
03:12:51<Laevos> oh okay
03:12:53<Laevos> derp <u>
03:13:05<Kita> Vacuum sealer, and a good freezer.
03:13:14<Laevos> Now it all makes SNES
03:14:47<Kita> o.o
03:15:30<Laevos> :3
03:15:34<Laevos> Has Kita seen Lilith's partner?
03:16:48<Kita> No?
03:17:01<Laevos> Much more the body type that Lilith enjoys than GROSS MUSCLES ~u~
03:17:23<Laevos> ( https://scontent-b-atl.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/t1.0-9/1461519_775662439115659_560800372_n.jpg )

03:22:08<Kita> Snuggle? Sure. Bedtime story? Don't have any.
03:22:28 Laevos: curls up on and tailsways
03:22:34<Laevos> I can feel it, Kitaaa
03:22:42<Kita> Oh?
03:22:44<Kita> X3
03:22:51<Laevos> I can feel sleep pulling down on me and trying to weigh me down, too
03:23:02 Kita: snickers.
03:23:10<Laevos> I don't know how much longer I can resist!! ;n;
03:23:16<Kita> Is sleep a sexy fat girl, too?
03:23:18<Kita> XP

13:18:34<Kita> It is giant weta.
13:18:36<Laevos> Never link me bug pictures please
13:18:39<Laevos> please
13:18:41<Kita> Largest insect in the world.

13:18:50 Kita: thought it was cute.
13:18:50<Kita> :<
13:18:52<Kita> Sorry.
13:18:55<Laevos> I hate bugs so much x_x
13:18:59<Laevos> few things terrify me more
13:19:11<Kita> What about MOTHS
13:19:13<Laevos> I can hardly even be around normal sized ones without going into fits
13:19:17<Laevos> FUCKING HATE MOTHS X_X
13:19:21<Laevos> Flying around trying to get into your face
13:19:26<Laevos> almost as bad a beetles
13:19:27<Kita> But they are so cute and tiny.
13:19:28<Laevos> *as
13:19:36<Kita> They really are cute.
13:19:42<Laevos> the ones around here are neither cute nor tiny
13:19:45<Kita> They have big eyes and fluffy antennae.
13:19:46<Kita> <3
13:19:48<Laevos> they are hueg
13:19:59<Laevos> ugh I hate their little legs and feather feelers
13:20:01<Laevos> so gross ;-;
13:20:12<Kita> Moths are tiny. Sure, maybe they are big for a MOTH, but all moths are still TINY.
13:20:35<Laevos> x_x
13:20:51<Laevos> Lilith cannot be around bugs
13:20:54<Kita> They are tiny. They can't hurt you. They like lights.
13:20:54<Laevos> she just can't handle it
13:21:03<Kita> Well.. Moths can't hurt you, anyway.
13:21:30<Laevos> she spent a night curled up on the living room couch crying herself to sleep because there was a bug in her room and after she came back with a paper towel she couldn't see it anymore and didn't know where it was
13:22:00<Kita> Most bugs are harmless, sweetie.
13:22:09<Laevos> whether they will harm me is not the issue
13:22:12<Laevos> they are /scary/ x_x
13:22:21<Laevos> and /gross/
13:22:37<Kita> How can something be scary if it can't hurt you?
13:22:49<Kita> And yeah, some bugs are gross.
13:22:53<Laevos> being afraid of the horrible sensations when they come near you
13:22:58<Laevos> that's what an phobia is
13:23:09<Kita> But moths are covered in dust that prevent them from being dirty.
13:23:22<Laevos> what
13:23:41<Kita> Yeah.
13:23:47<Kita> The dust is super inert.
13:24:13<Kita> But they leave the dust wherever they land, and don't take microbials with them
13:24:16<Kita> Because dust.
13:24:19<Kita> o.o;
13:24:28<Laevos> so they are dusty
13:24:32<Kita> Yeah.
13:24:37<Laevos> that is even more gross than I imagined ;-;
13:24:39<Kita> And the dust is inert and harmless.
13:24:46<Laevos> it's gross though
13:24:48<Laevos> look at it ;-;
13:25:02<Kita> It's like being covered in powdered sugar
13:25:06<Kita> Except not sticky.
13:25:27<Kita> Moths are fuzzy, too.
13:25:28<Laevos> that would freak me out too @_@
13:25:31<Kita> Is so adourable.
13:26:09<Laevos> the cats at Lilith's house kill bugs on sight

13:26:38<Kita> Just look at it, though.
13:26:42<Laevos> sry but no
13:26:48<Laevos> I'm not going to knowingly set off my phobia
13:27:02<Kita> It looks more like a stuffed animal than a bug.
13:27:25<Laevos> As a life form that is aware of the existence of her own homeostasis, it is in my best interest to preserve it >_>
13:31:19<Kita> :<
13:31:29<Kita> HOW SCARY
13:31:31<Kita> CAN SOMETHING
13:31:37<Kita> Called the POODLE MOTH be
13:31:38<Kita> D:
13:31:45<Laevos> 200% scary
13:31:50<Laevos> 100 from being a moth
13:31:55<Laevos> and 100 from being a poodle
13:32:05<Kita> Poodles are scary?
13:32:15<Laevos> they're weird dogs
13:32:20<Laevos> second only to chihuahuas
13:32:29<Laevos> which are just little rats disguised as dogs
13:33:19<Kita> Poodles are better if you don't shave them weirdly.
13:33:50<Laevos> I'm sure they taste much better without all that hair, sure

17:46:09<Kita> Meh. Whatever. Like =! Good. Dislike =! Bad. There is often a correalation, but it isn't DEFINITIVE.
17:46:29<Laevos> Yeah yeah :c
17:46:46<Kita> If you're super into music, you will disregard games, movies, whatever because they have poorly timed and poorly themed music.
17:47:23<Kita> And you may like things that have bad actors or tons of glitches and plot holes, because the music sets the mood very nicely and is well-performed.
17:47:29<Laevos> Uguu~ ;u;
17:47:53<Kita> Using major keys during the protag's lover's death scene is fucking wrong.
17:47:57<Kita> You shouldn't do it.
17:48:00<Laevos> lol
17:48:04<Laevos> unless you want to be amazing xux
17:48:11<Laevos> or are making a YouTube Poop
17:48:21<Kita> Yeah. It just... It breaks the mood.
17:48:27<Laevos> No shit xD
17:48:32<Laevos> but yeah
17:48:39<Kita> I'm supposed to be sad? okay. Why is this happy ass pop shit here
17:48:57<Kita> There are ways to SUBVERT the minor key, major key trope.
17:49:10<Laevos> Has Kita ever seen an actual movie where there was such a huge lapse? xD
17:49:17<Laevos> That seems like you'd almost have to be doing it on purpose
17:49:20<Kita> YES.
17:49:22<Kita> KITA HAS.
17:49:26<Laevos> looooool
17:49:29<Kita> Kita has also seen GAMES do it, too.
17:49:53<Kita> Kita has also seen the music tropes subverted, and it WORKED.
17:50:14<Kita> Like playing happy J-Rock during the Kickass scenes where Hit-Girl is fucking shit up.
17:50:16<Kita> It worked.
17:50:28<Kita> She is a little girl, with a Japanese hero style to her.
17:50:30<Kita> It works.
17:50:51<Kita> It is weird, and unexpected, and before you really think about it you're not sure why, but it DOES work.
17:51:30<Kita> But you have to be CAREFUL.
17:51:46<Kita> You can't put happy carnival music in Batman when he is fighting the Penguin.
17:51:53<Kita> But you CAN if it is the Joker.
17:52:22<Laevos> :3
17:52:26<Kita> These are SUPER IMPORTANT IDEAS in movies AND games.
17:52:38<Laevos> Yeah I know how sounds work ;w;
17:52:38<Kita> And anime, too!
17:53:06<Kita> Like... Every time Ryuuko was about to do something AMAZING in Kill la Kill, they play HER MAIN FUCKING THEME.
17:53:17<Kita> "Don't lose your waaa~aaay~"
17:53:23<Laevos> Yeah it was pretty obvious
17:53:24<Kita> This is super important!
17:53:33<Laevos> I'M NOT SOME IGNORAMUS
17:53:45<Kita> No, but Kita likes ranting.
17:53:48<Laevos> Oh okay
17:53:52<Laevos> continue, then xD
17:53:57<Kita> This isn't to inform, this is to be listened to.
17:54:05<Laevos> I thought you were under the impressioni that Lilith didn't know shit about this :c
17:54:06<Kita> And entertaining.
17:54:07<Laevos> but yes, continue!
17:54:08<Kita> No.
17:54:09<Kita> <3
17:54:11<Laevos> I like hearing Kitarants ;u;
17:54:13 Laevos: licks~
17:54:14<Kita> Lilith is very informed.
17:54:20<Kita> N is not.
17:54:40<Laevos> This does appear to be the case >_>
17:55:01<Kita> But like... If you do this kind of stuff badly it is OFFPUTTING to people who are ALIGNED with the aspect of the techniques.
17:55:17<Kita> Bad animation doesn't set off everyone. It sets off artists of the drawn medium.
17:55:32<Laevos> Yeah
17:55:35<Kita> Bad CG doesn't set off everyone. It sets off artists of the digital medium.
17:55:45<Kita> Bad music only pisses off music people.
17:55:56<Laevos> my friend's like that in regards to video stuff
17:55:56<Laevos> liike
17:56:10<Laevos> did you hear the thing about where Mario Kart 8 will drop a frame every once in a while?
17:56:12<Kita> So even if you don't care? Someone does. And that makes the poor techniques POOR.
17:56:15<Kita> Yeah.
17:56:22<Kita> To Kita, that isn't a big deal.
17:56:40<Kita> For some people? "OH MY FUCKING GOD. THE FRAMERATE IS GARBAGE. GAME IS LAGGY. FUCK."
17:57:28<Laevos> Yeah
17:57:30<Kita> Kita views it as consequence of Nintendo's actually IMPRESSIVE capability to SQUEEZE every last inch of power out of their hardware.
17:57:32<Laevos> he was freaking out about that
17:57:35<Laevos> and yeah, I agree
17:57:39<Laevos> it didn't affect me at all
17:57:44<Laevos> you can notice it if you look for it, I guess
17:57:47<Laevos> but \(o.o)/
17:58:05<Kita> It was fine. You can't notice it. It is above 25 FPS. Human perception is unaffected.
17:58:17<Laevos> Hehehe :3
17:58:21<Laevos> Yeah, I couldn't notice it at all
17:58:22<Kita> Sometimes you go from 30 to 29 and a skip.
17:58:29<Laevos> but people certainly claim to
17:58:40<Kita> They can't. They say they can, but it isn't possible.
17:58:50<Kita> Their eyes are incapable. Just biologically.
17:59:10<Kita> They may do a half-blink, and think they saw a frame skip.
17:59:49<Kita> You know why NO ONE can properly time the Teleport Dash Extension in Sonic 06, not even Paraxade, the former world record holder for that speed run?
18:00:14<Kita> Because it has to be on EXACTLY the last frame of his little animation. And it is going at 60 FPS, sometimes.
18:00:24<Kita> You can't see that.
18:00:27<Kita> You mash and hope.
18:00:34<Kita> That is what speedrunners do.
18:00:44<Kita> At least, without doing TAS.
18:00:46<Laevos> ;w;
18:01:37<Kita> Sure, there is a technical flaw with the game.
18:01:45<Kita> Yeah, any flaw takes away from the experience... but only if it is perceivable.
18:01:53<Laevos> More like Sonic 666
18:02:49<Kita> Heh.
18:04:02<Laevos> Hehehehehehehehehe
18:04:56<Kita> Or like...
18:04:58<Kita> Egoraptor
18:05:34<Kita> He makes Sequelitis. A series where he criticises games that are sequels of good games.
18:05:40<Laevos> o:
18:05:54<Kita> And he did Ocarina of Time (and really just 3-D Zelda in general?)
18:06:07<Laevos> Uh-huh
18:06:38<Kita> Ocarina of Time is GOOD. Not flawless. And the flaws in it really stood out to him, because of what he does in his life and his interests. As a result, he didn't like it.
18:06:42<Kita> AND THAT IS OKAY.
18:06:48<Kita> He points out the flaws!
18:06:54<Kita> Flaws are EVERYWHERE.
18:07:07<Kita> Being AWARE of them doesn't change whether or not they exist.
18:07:18<Kita> It isn't like they don't exist BEFORE they are pointed out.
18:07:28<Kita> We just ignore them, and we can go right back to doing that.
18:07:38<Kita> Being aware of the flaws just means we don't REPEAT THEM.
18:11:04<Kita> So like yeah. Things can be both good and flawed.
18:11:22<Kita> Good just means it is worth more of your time than other things in its medium.
18:12:56<Laevos> :3
18:13:12<Kita> Kill la Kill has flaws!
18:13:35<Kita> They took some animation short cuts.
18:13:35<Kita> They were on a budget.
18:14:52<Laevos> Yeah, all the fight scenes are super lazy :P
18:15:06<Laevos> But that's fine

18:24:23<Kita> Honestly
18:24:30<Kita> In Kill la Kill it worked.
18:24:41<Kita> It wasn't ABOUT the fights. It was about WHY they were fighting.
18:24:51<Kita> And that changed. Every fucking episode.
18:25:03<Kita> As Ryuuko learns all the pieces, her reason to fight changes.
18:25:10<Kita> But it does change arbitrarily.
18:25:12<Kita> It EVOLVES.

18:39:05<Kita> Art is Kita's jam.
18:39:10<Kita> Kita arts.
18:39:22<Kita> and the analysis of art is a window into human psychology.
18:39:37<Kita> A subject Kita enjoys discussing.
18:40:00<Kita> and Kita's physical form is not immortal.

18:51:04<Kita> Kita only has so much time to nibble on the juicy art.
18:51:26<Laevos> This is true ;n;
18:52:52<Kita> So Kita doesn't want a lot of bad stuff.
18:53:01<Kita> She wants good stuff.
18:53:22<Laevos> Yeah
18:53:27<Laevos> no time to waste on stupid crap >:c
18:54:14<Kita> Exactly.
18:54:14<Kita> :<
18:58:27<Laevos> So no time for silly things like Stupid Anime Originality-free foolishness!
18:58:38 Kita: nods.

04:17:46<Laevos> Hi Q_Q
04:17:58 Kita: bites <3
04:18:03 Laevos: shivers ;//////;
04:20:20<Kita> So like
04:20:41<Kita> Before Kita actually started caring about music... Back when it was an interest, not an informed topic...
04:20:53<Kita> Kita used to listen to a lot of punk
04:22:20<Kita> And so... Bad Religion is one of the punk bands that you can't really go without knowing about if you were into punk, but back then? They really weren't.
04:22:55<Kita> They alienated potential listeners by being intellectual, hyper-critical, and above all... atheist.
04:23:29<Kita> "Hey, Mother Mercy can your loins bear fruit forever? Is your fecundity a trammel or a treasuuu~rrrre"
04:23:54<Kita> This is still the SINGLE use of the word "fecundity" that Kita has ever heard in MUSIC.
04:24:13 Kita: thinks she has heard trammel somewhere, though.
04:24:41<Kita> So like... Even though Kita has grown out of punk music, there is still a good bit of respect for at least that band.
04:24:57<Laevos> woah hi
04:25:05<Kita> Hi. Talking.
04:25:06<Kita> XP
04:25:50<Laevos> here u go bb: http://www.metal-archives.com/search/advanced/searching/songs?songTitle=&bandName=&releaseTitle=&lyrics=fecundity&genre=#songs
04:25:59<Laevos> dunno other sites with such a search feature
04:27:15<Kita> X3
04:27:16<Laevos> I only recognize  like
04:27:21<Laevos> one of those albums though
04:27:28<Laevos> Xibalba's "Ah Dzam Poop Ek"
04:27:34<Kita> o.o
04:28:11<Laevos> it was
04:28:11<Laevos> okay
04:28:36<Laevos> two years younger than me
04:28:41<Laevos> :3
04:29:01<Kita> 22 sons.
04:29:13<Kita> In all of metal.
04:30:01<Kita> So... despite Kita disagreeing in SOME areas of "The Metal Archives"
04:30:20<Kita> And disagreeing with the userbase sometimes being hostile OUTSIDE of The Metal Archives...
04:31:04<Kita> (Like.. Not disagreeing that they are sometimes hostile, but disagreeing that it is an acceptable behaviour)
04:31:34<Kita> The Metal Archives are what separate Metal fans from say, like... Pop fans...or Alt fans...
04:31:53<Kita> The idea behind them, anyway.
04:32:04<Laevos> Uguu
04:32:08<Kita> If Metal ever dies.
04:32:15<Laevos> IF I EVER DIEEEEEEE
04:32:17<Laevos> I WANNA KNOW
04:32:18<Kita> We can always point to that website
04:32:19<Laevos> WHEN
04:32:21<Laevos> AAAAAAAND WHYYYYYYYYYY
04:32:22<Laevos> yeah
04:32:25<Laevos> it'll always be a thing
04:32:27<Kita> And be like
04:32:55<Kita> "Look at that. That is a fucking testament to the genre. Metal was loved. It has been left behind, but it will always be there."
04:32:56<Laevos> "What were they thinking...?" xux
04:33:00<Laevos> Hehehe, or that :D
04:33:04<Laevos> and yeah
04:33:05<Laevos> I love that site
04:33:09<Laevos> I try to help out as much as I can
04:33:11<Laevos> and stuff
04:33:24<Kita> So, when it comes to genre wars and stuff.
04:33:28<Laevos> xux
04:33:37<Kita> You know... Some people think Stoner and Doom are the same.
04:33:41<Laevos> Yep :c
04:33:45 Laevos: sighs
04:33:47<Kita> And that Stoner Metal shouldn't be separated out.
04:33:49<Laevos> having to deal with some dramas ;n;
04:33:56<Laevos> those people are wrong >:c
04:34:01<Kita> And Kita can see why they think that...
04:34:06<Kita> But yeah, it is wrong.
04:34:13<Kita> They are very similar
04:34:22<Kita> But Speed and Power Metal are similar, too.
04:34:27<Kita> And they are different.
04:34:34<Laevos> yeah
04:34:37<Kita> Also
04:34:40<Kita> No one.
04:34:44<Kita> And Kita means NO ONE
04:34:44<Laevos> o_o
04:34:48<Kita> Should EVER
04:34:51<Kita> Call DragonForce
04:34:56<Kita> A Speed Metal band.
04:35:00<Laevos> Indeed not xD
04:35:07<Kita> Kita will fucking rip their throat out and beat them with it.
04:35:07<Laevos> "but they r fast"
04:35:16<Kita> No. They're fucking POWER.
04:35:19<Kita> POWER METAL.
04:35:21<Laevos> Indeed xux
04:35:24<Kita> God damnit
04:35:28<Kita> KITA DAMNIT
04:35:35 Laevos: gasps ;n;
04:35:42<Kita> KITANA KOJIKO KAZAMA DAMN IT ALL
04:35:51 Laevos: faints
04:35:52 Kita: throws her arms up
04:35:59<Laevos> need some smelling salts to recover
04:35:59<Kita> Fuckin did ti
04:36:14<Laevos> from hearing the Lady's name used in vain ;n;;;;
04:36:27<Kita> And please, please don't call out Kita on the name her VERY Japanese bio father gave her
04:36:31<Kita> Kita knows her initials.
04:36:32<Kita> x.x
04:36:49<Laevos> I didn't even notice
04:36:53<Laevos> so sleepy
04:36:59<Kita> Its there
04:37:05<Kita> It makes Kita upset sometimes.
04:37:16<Kita> But like
04:37:22<Kita> How was he supposed to know
04:37:26<Kita> He was Japanese
04:37:39<Kita> He got a fucking letter from the British prossy he knocked up
04:37:47<Kita> And she died in childbirth
04:37:52<Kita> So he named the kid, and left
04:37:54<Kita> For forever
04:37:57<Kita> Fucking asshole
04:38:02<Kita> NAMES THE KID
04:38:04<Kita> LEAVES
04:38:05<Kita> FUCK
04:39:09<Kita> Kita wishes SHAME on his house.
04:39:15<Laevos> Q_Q
04:39:18<Laevos> Lilith loves you
04:39:21<Laevos> Goddess <3 ;-;
04:39:22<Kita> May her curse be heard
04:39:30 Kita: throws her hand into the air.
04:39:37<Kita> Kita knows. Lilith is so loyal.
04:39:38<Kita> <3
04:39:48<Laevos> Forever <3
04:39:55<Laevos> ugh, dramas ;n;
04:40:01<Kita> Forever
04:40:18<Laevos> FOREVER ;u;
04:40:47<Kita> FOREVER
04:42:36<Laevos> Forever O_O
04:42:36 Kita: drips goop on Lilith
04:42:39 Laevos: goops
04:43:34<Kita> glorp
04:43:37<Kita> bloop
04:43:53<Laevos> so
04:44:04<Laevos> my brother and I were talking to a mutal friend on Skype
04:44:14<Kita> Was it the one
04:44:19<Kita> That called Kita a hacker
04:44:20<Laevos> and we were having fun reading a book that my Grandma gave me
04:44:21<Kita> on Showdown
04:44:21<Laevos> (no)
04:44:37<Laevos> and trying to teacher how to be a good Straight Christian Male
04:44:42<Laevos> which was the point of that book
04:44:50<Laevos> and basically just having us a good time
04:44:50<Kita> Pfff
04:44:56<Laevos> then she starts texting us both
04:45:02<Laevos> and
04:45:07<Laevos> kind of
04:45:20<Laevos> asks us to make out
04:45:24<Laevos> which we didn't do
04:45:42<Laevos> so she felt really guilty afterwards and went into a depressive episode
04:45:54<Laevos> so we've both been trying to help her out of it for the past few hours
04:45:55<Kita> Jeez
04:45:58<Laevos> to little avail ;-;
04:46:39<Laevos> she's done that kind of thing before
04:46:42<Laevos> kind of a yaoi fangirl

04:49:59AlbinoFox is now known as Kita
04:50:12<Kita> She lacks the tact to pull off a casual mentioning
04:50:24<Laevos> a little bit
04:50:29<Laevos> I mean the two of them are 16 so
04:50:34<Laevos> guess tact isn't really to be expected
04:50:57<Kita> "So wait, if you were into him... could I maybe ask a favour?"
04:51:33 Laevos: shrugs
04:51:46<Laevos> I would've done it if he'd been okay with it, but he's not interested and he has a boyfriend
04:51:48<Kita> There are ways
04:51:58<Kita> To ask this stuff
04:52:03<Kita> She does not know them
04:52:08<Laevos> yeah
04:52:26<Kita> If you get the chance
04:52:28<Kita> Teach them
04:52:35<Kita> to her
04:52:44<Laevos> I'll do my best ;n;
04:54:37<Laevos> and then my brother and I felt really guilty
04:54:42<Laevos> for making her sad
04:54:50<Laevos> and not at least hugging or something
04:54:59<Laevos> because we're easiliy worried
04:55:04<Laevos> *easily
04:55:17<Kita> Also easily manipulated.
04:55:26<Laevos> I definitely am ~u~
04:55:28<Kita> Don't feel bad. You didn't do anything wrong.
04:55:38<Kita> She is the one her stuck her foot in her mouth.
04:55:57<Kita> Don't be mean, and definitely show concern, but you should have zero guilt.
04:56:02<Laevos> That's why I need Kita to manipulate me ;n;
04:56:26<Kita> Kita does not manipulate.
04:56:36<Kita> Kita decrees, and Lilith chooses to follow.
04:56:47<Laevos> this is true
04:56:58<Laevos> I suppose that's my subbiness talking ;//////;
04:57:16<Laevos> I have such rigid control over aspects of my life
04:57:34<Laevos> but inside it excites me to think about having those ripped away and controlled by someone else x///////x
04:58:00 Laevos: hides x_x
04:58:05 Kita: rubs her chin.
04:58:18<Kita> Kita's only submission is to her unbridled gluttony.
04:58:48 Laevos: nods :3
04:58:52<Laevos> Kita's very powerful
04:59:00<Laevos> someone who makes Lilith want to submit to her utterly x/////////x

02:15:52<Kita> Catching Zangoose is Y is so much easier than catching Seviper in X.
02:16:02<Kita> So
02:16:25<Kita> In Pokemon X and Y, you can encounter hordes of Pokemon. They are groups of 5, very underleveled, Pokemon.
02:16:37<Kita> They are NORMALLY all of the same species.
02:16:46<Kita> But there are exceptions!
02:17:02<Kita> Zangoose hordes have a Seviper, and vice versa.
02:17:15<Kita> Zangoose and Seviper will attack eachother before they attack you.

02:58:57<Kita> So
02:59:12<Kita> Seviper is Poison, and Zangoose is Normal.
02:59:44<Kita> You get Bulldoze, and can catch a Skiddo right before you get to the area where these two are.
02:59:48<Laevos> falling asleep soon ;n;
02:59:52<Kita> Okay.
02:59:53<Kita> <3
03:00:01<Laevos> <3
03:00:21<Kita> Bulldoze will hit ALL horde Pokemon, and the level difference will help OHKO all the Seviper.
03:00:27<Kita> The Zangoose survives.
03:00:33<Kita> And you can catch it.
03:00:35<Kita> In X?
03:00:54<Kita> Zangoose is the dominant one.
03:01:07<Kita> Normal-types are only weak to Fighting.

22:42:58 Kita: is playing Other M. It is a good game, but they ruined Samus.
22:43:18<Laevos> Is that the one where her voice actor is total shit?
22:43:19<Laevos> THE BABY
22:43:55<Kita> X3
22:43:57<Kita> The baby
22:44:08<Laevos> DAH BAYYYYYBAYY
22:44:16<Kita> Her voice actor isn't shit, but it isn't fitting.
22:44:21<Laevos> Err, yeah
22:44:22<Kita> And her script was poor.
22:44:47<Kita> The baby? It was more often referred to as the "Research Specimen"
22:44:50<Laevos> :CCCCCC
22:44:53<Laevos> :cccccc
22:45:12<Kita> Team Ninja are good developers. Poor writers.
22:46:00<Laevos> Yeah :c
22:46:42<Kita> Supporting cast is great, though!
22:46:50<Laevos> :D
22:46:55<Kita> The General being a hardass is fitting.
22:47:00<Laevos> :33
22:47:10<Kita> Anthony, the black guy, being the happy, optimist?
22:47:12<Kita> Also fitting.
22:48:59<Kita> Overall? The game is fun.
22:49:18<Kita> And Samus is silent, until you get to cutscenes, and she doesn't speak ALL THE TIME...
22:49:19<Kita> So...
22:49:27<Laevos> REMEMBER ME?
22:49:35<Kita> o.o;
22:51:37<Laevos> That line was from that, right?
22:51:52 Kita: shrugs?
22:52:04<Kita> Haven't gotten that far.
22:52:06<Laevos> Anthony says it ;-;
22:52:06<Laevos> oh
22:52:11<Laevos> when he first shows up? ;-;
22:53:41<Kita> Oh.
22:53:50<Kita> That wasn't poorly delivered.
22:54:05<Laevos> No
22:54:06<Laevos> it was great
22:54:19<Kita> o.o
22:54:31<Kita> Anthony is cool, yo.
22:54:41<Laevos> Yes  :3
22:55:20<Kita> Samus having to be saved though
22:55:24<Kita> Not okay
22:55:29<Laevos> ;n;
22:55:34<Kita> Samus is the SAVIOUR
22:55:37<Kita> Not the damsel.
22:55:49<Laevos> Indeed :c
22:55:57<Kita> Like
22:56:00<Kita> In Super Metroid
22:56:04<Kita> It was okay
22:56:33<Kita> The Research Specimen was saving her perceived mommy.
22:56:33<Kita> Which was super touching, and Mother Brain is fucking HARD.
22:56:37<Kita> So that was cool.
22:56:49<Kita> and even then, Samus STILL has to win.
22:57:27<Kita> So it more of an assist, than a save.
23:02:26<Laevos> Oh okay

19:28:49<Kita> Also
19:28:55<Kita> Look at all the Mario characters.
19:29:09<Kita> Mario, Luigi, Bowser, Peach, Yoshi, and technically DK?
19:29:19<Laevos> So many marios
19:29:22<Kita> (Though DK, like Yoshi, went to star in his own games.)
19:29:27<Laevos> plus the other one
19:29:31<Laevos> from Galaxy or w/e she was in
19:29:38<Kita> Oh, and Rosalina&Luma.
19:29:41<Laevos> yeah
19:29:41<Laevos> :3
19:29:55<Kita> And we've had Dr. Mario in the past, too.
19:30:04<Kita> It isn't that Kita thinks Mario is a bad series...
19:30:20<Kita> But why do we need SEVEN Mario characters.
19:30:32<Kita> (Wario, if he returns, will make it eight.)
19:30:59<Kita> Yoshi is cool, and all, but he doesn't really DESERVE his place in Smash.
19:31:06<Kita> As an assist trophy, he would be cool.
19:31:32<Kita> But he was only included in the beginning because they didn't have enough of a roster, and used him and Jiggly to round it out.
19:32:04<Laevos> Jigglypuff was so powerful in Melee xux
19:32:05<Laevos> SO POWERFUL
19:32:06<Kita> We have Link, Zelda, Shiek, Toon Link, and maybe Ganondorf.
19:32:14<Kita> That is a LOT of Zelda.
19:32:20<Laevos> 2manyzelda
19:32:20<Kita> And why split Shiek/Zelda?
19:32:47<Kita> Zelda needed Sheik for damage, and Sheik needed Zelda for finishers!
19:33:57<Kita> Fox/Falco was always unneccessary.
19:34:09<Kita> Fox and Wolf play differently enough for Wolf to be worth it.
19:36:02<Laevos> b/c ur worth it 2
19:36:56<Laevos> okay, so
19:37:00<Laevos> really weird thing
19:37:09<Laevos> Lilith was bringing some CDs back from her apartment today totry and clear it out
19:37:26<Laevos> she found a compilation from some label that one of her music/trade partners had sent her
19:37:30<Laevos> puts it on
19:37:35<Laevos> first track: some kind of noise thing
19:37:41<Laevos> second track: some kind of grindcore thing
19:37:52<Laevos> third track: some kind of dark ambient/industrial thing
19:37:58<Laevos> fifth track: some kind of sludgy death metal
19:38:00<Laevos> FOURTH TRACK
19:38:19<Laevos> some kind of this shit: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVl38L5wrc
19:38:44<Laevos> TW: Some kind of upbeat Christian folk
19:40:51<Kita> o.o
19:41:39<Laevos> O_O
19:43:10<Kita> O.o
19:43:30<Laevos> OoO
19:48:01<Laevos> So what is Kita up to? o:
19:48:53<Kita> Discussing why Ike belongs in Smash.
19:49:41<Laevos> Oh okay
19:53:12<Laevos> http://ded.increpare.com/~locus/Spiders_And_Cubes_Flash/
19:54:04<Kita> o.o
19:54:37<Laevos> is video game
19:56:16<Kita> Ah.
19:57:22<Laevos> kind of
19:59:05<Kita> Their argument...
19:59:41<Kita> "You just like Ike because he hits hard. He was only in two games that are old, and he is irrelevant to Nintendo."
19:59:49<Laevos> omgggg
19:59:58<Laevos> they're irrelevant to Nintendo ~u~
20:00:11<Kita> If Kita just liked characters that hit hard, Kita would just play Ganondorf or DK.
20:00:24<Kita> Who have ZERO anti-air game, and hit a LOT harder than Ike.
20:00:42<Kita> Also, if they miss, it is less crucial to the battle.
20:00:57<Kita> Ike requires patience, awareness, and timing.
20:01:13<Laevos> ;u;
20:01:15<Kita> Heavy characters lack air game. Ike pulls characters out of the air.
20:01:31<Laevos> My friends were playing Brawl when I went over there for a bit today
20:01:33<Laevos> I joined them
20:01:37<Laevos> didn't really have any fun ^~^
20:01:40<Kita> Who did you play?
20:02:12<Kita> Also, if you're not practiced, you tend to not.
20:02:13<Kita> :<
20:02:29<Kita> Casual players have a hard time playing with non-casuals, in Kita's experience.
20:03:22<Laevos> Nobody was like
20:03:28<Laevos> a non-casual player
20:03:32<Laevos> I always play as Kirby
20:03:38<Laevos> I don't think I enjoy Smash Bros. much anymore
20:03:45<Laevos> Plus, there were no items >u>
20:04:01<Kita> Kita plays as Ike, a lot, but she likes to mix it up, from time to time.
20:04:35<Kita> Pokemon Trainer (for Charizard), Lucario, and Sonic are all choices Kita picks often, when she isn't going for Ike.
20:04:39<Kita> Mixing it up is fun.
20:04:59<Laevos> :3
20:05:25<Kita> Also, Smash Bros. is very much a game where you get out what you put in.
20:05:40<Laevos> Uguu~
20:05:48<Kita> The more play time you put in, and the better you get, the more fun you have, because you can SEE progress.
20:05:58<Kita> (Also, Kita plays a lot of R.O.B.)
20:06:20<Laevos> Yeah... don't have time to do that ^~^
20:06:24<Laevos> nor any desire to :c
20:06:35<Kita> And that is fine.
20:06:41<Kita> It isn't for everyone.

02:07:36<Kita> So
02:08:06<Kita> The "slippery slope" argument that comes up in discussions about LGBT with anti-LGBT individuals
02:08:12<Kita> Often, they bring up incest.
02:08:34<Kita> What is so bad about incest between two consenting adults?
02:08:52<Laevos> Nothing >:c
02:09:07<Kita> (There are some increased chances in birth defects, but not all relationships bear fruit, so to speak.)
02:09:15<Kita> But like
02:09:17<Laevos> Indeed!
02:09:30<Kita> Consensual incest is a moot point.
02:09:48<Laevos> Yeah... it really is :/
02:09:55<Kita> Two adults, regardless of their relations in any regard, have the right to make their own choices.
02:10:07 Laevos: nods ;n;
02:10:25<Kita> Then they bring up aliens or bestiality
02:10:37<Kita> Again, a moot point, in Kita's opinion.
02:10:40<Laevos> aliens
02:10:43<Laevos> omg
02:10:50<Kita> Only sentient beings are capable of giving consent.
02:11:04<Kita> If the beings are sentient, then they have their right to choose, as well.
02:11:21<Kita> If the beings are not matured or sentient, then you have an instance of rape

02:17:48<Kita> But whatever
02:17:54<Kita> Humans are horribly inefficient.
02:19:08<Laevos> Yeah :3
02:19:40<Kita> And our sentience is the key to our organisation, anyway.

18:03:27<Kita> Palestine wasn't even a place or people until 50 years ago.
18:03:46<Kita> Outcasts from the bigger Muslim sects.
18:04:07<Kita> They both need to be tied down, beaten with a dildo, and told to quit acting like children with missles.

20:32:39<Laevos> oh
20:32:45<Kita> o.o;
20:32:50 Kita: got a little ranty
20:32:50<Laevos> I guess that's a world conflict that exists
20:32:57<Kita> Yeah.
20:33:12<Laevos> :ccccccccccccc
20:33:17<Laevos> And it's okay
20:33:44 Kita: thinks her opinion is reasonable
20:33:45<Laevos> I exist as a vessel for your ranting xux
20:34:15<Laevos> and it very well may be
20:35:02<Laevos> I have no knowledge of the situation and therefore no opinion ;w;
20:36:01<Kita> Well... Israel is committing genocide, and kill thousands of civillians. And that is NOT a thing that should be happening. However, Palestine is an Islam upstart in Israel that is very, very anti-semetic, and put the Hamas in power, and the Hamas are known puppets for Muslim-based terrorism.
20:36:09<Kita> So like, the whole situation is a pile of shit.
20:36:31<Laevos> I may or may not look into it someday
20:36:54<Kita> The problem is that criticising either side makes you racist.
20:37:02<Kita> Criticise Israel and you're anti-Jew
20:37:38<Kita> and criticising Palestine makes you anti-Muslim.
20:37:44<Laevos> gotta spend my limited emotional resources wisely
20:37:49<Kita> Criticising both makes you anti-Semetic
20:37:56<Laevos> can't afford to spread myself too thin ;-;
20:37:58 Kita: is filled with all the emotions.
20:38:14<Kita> Oh, and ignoring makes you ignorant of world politics.
20:38:15<Kita> :<
20:38:23<Kita> And Kita ignored it for a while.
20:38:30<Laevos> I've been called worse names xux

20:39:13<Kita> Fuck Israel
20:39:17<Kita> Fuck the Middle East.
20:39:38<Kita> Take out the women and children and atheists, and glass the entire fucking region.
20:40:15<Laevos> put glass over it
20:40:28<Kita> Oh no.
20:40:29<Laevos> they'll probably be able to get through it eventually
20:40:31<Kita> Build a space laser.
20:40:31<Laevos> maybe
20:40:36<Laevos> it'll probably get too hot

20:40:46<Kita> MAKE IT AS GLASS
20:40:47<Laevos> okay Ronald Regan
20:41:02<Kita> No. Kita refers to glassing things in the Halo sense.
20:41:28<Kita> In the Halo series, the evil alien conquerors, The Covenant, use giant lasers to burn the surfaces of planets.
20:41:34<Laevos> Regan was the BUILD ME SPACE LASERS president
20:41:37<Laevos> :P
20:41:38<Kita> Dirt, when lasered, makes dirty glass.
20:41:43<Kita> Oh.
20:41:44<Kita> Well
20:41:55<Kita> We should build space lasers, in case of meteorites.

22:04:14<Kita> HUZZAH
22:04:45<Laevos> welcome back Goddess <3
22:05:40<Laevos> ghoast
22:05:42<Kita> Unfortunately, versioning Kita does not return with the name of her modded IRC client.
22:05:43<Kita> o.o
22:05:48<Laevos> :ccc
22:05:51<Kita> Ghoast?
22:06:04<Laevos> GHOAST
22:06:05<Laevos> wait
22:06:07<Laevos> why did I say that
22:06:20<Laevos> I misread something...
22:06:32<Kita> o.
22:06:34<Kita> o.o*
22:08:43 Kita: points to the link she posted in Pepper's channel.
22:09:25<Laevos> Saw it <3
22:09:44<Kita> Growlithe the reading-dog
22:09:45<Kita> <3
22:09:53<Laevos> :3
22:09:57<Laevos> how can a Growlithe read
22:10:05<Laevos> ?????
22:11:16<Kita> Growlithe does not read.
22:11:45<Kita> Some libraries have a room where children can go to read to a dog or cat.
22:12:07<Kita> It is for children with reading disabilities.
22:12:16<Laevos> oh okay
22:12:46<Kita> They have an easier time reading to the dog, because the dog does not judge them. The dog just enjoys the company, and the children DO want to read.

22:29:20<Laevos> yeah
22:29:21<Laevos> that makes sense
22:30:20<Kita> Also
22:30:48<Kita> There are two things that humans enjoying playing with, above all else.
22:31:00<Kita> Their genitals and their brains are these things.
22:31:29<Laevos> :3
22:31:32<Laevos> why not both
22:31:43<Kita> (The asexual often play with their brains, and the mentally deficient CERTAINLY play with their genitals.)
22:31:52<Kita> So like...
22:31:57<Laevos> WHAT'RE YOU TRYING TO SAY, KITA?
22:32:05<Kita> Why does this make drugs and prostitution bad things?
22:32:07<Kita> :<
22:32:13<Laevos> o
22:32:37<Kita> Kita doesn't particularly USE the services provided by prostitutes...
22:32:46<Kita> But Kita doesn't why she shouldn't be able to.
22:33:15<Laevos> No yeah I agree
22:33:19<Laevos> just wasn't where I was expecting that to go

23:03:25<Kita> Ugh.
23:03:47<Kita> "Research shows that decriminalising prostitution creates a boom in human trafficking!"
23:04:26<Kita> They forget to add "...in third world countries, and areas with poor regulation, no regulation, and poor funding for regulation."
23:04:33<Laevos> Uguu ;n;
23:04:34<Kita> Because legal =! regulated
23:05:01<Kita> Most places with legalised prostitution have almost no regulation.
23:05:10<Laevos> yeah
23:05:39<Kita> New Zealand? Super strict regulation. Traffickers are busted immediately, and as a result, there are fewer traffickers in New Zealand.
23:06:09<Kita> Human trafficking is practically null in NZ and Aussie Land.
23:06:21<Kita> (For the purposes of prostitution.)
23:07:07<Laevos> ya
23:07:45<Kita> Oh... Amsterdam is pretty clean, too.
23:07:57<Kita> Not as clean as Down Under, but they are also less strict.
23:08:09<Laevos> probz
23:10:22 Kita: pokes her nose.
23:10:30<Laevos> Hi
23:10:42<Kita> Whatcha doin'.
23:11:03<Laevos> trying to figure out how to fix my brain
23:14:34<Kita> ?
23:14:52<Laevos> well I kind of tried to kill myself yesterday and I've been down all day today still
23:14:59<Laevos> resulting in me getting all of absolutely nothing done
23:15:01<Laevos> and it's ruining my life
23:15:12<Kita> Sweetie...
23:15:17<Kita> You had a moment of weakness
23:15:36<Laevos> I now
23:15:41<Kita> But even in your weakest moments, you defy the metaphorical demons that haunt you.
23:15:42<Laevos> but I've been in a downswing for a while now
23:15:51<Laevos> and it's rendered me incapable of basic function
23:16:11<Laevos> when I'm in an upswing, I can get lots of things done and believe that I can get even more things done
23:16:11<Kita> You didn't fail in killing yourself. You succeeded in thwarting your own suicide attempt.
23:16:13<Laevos> at times like this
23:16:20<Laevos> I can't do anything
23:16:25<Laevos> and I can't take this cycle anymore
23:16:27 Kita: lifts her chin.
23:16:32<Kita> Lilith.
23:16:57<Laevos> yes, Goddess?
23:17:23<Kita> You're a winner. You win at life.
23:17:48<Kita> You're still alive, and that makes you better at life than everyone who died yesterday.
23:17:58<Laevos> x_x but this has been going on for years...
23:18:02<Kita> You even play on hard mode.
23:18:10<Laevos> I'm sick of being completely out of commission for half of my life...
23:18:30<Kita> That's okay.
23:18:41<Kita> That is perfectly normal.
23:18:58 Kita: can't imagine a person who WOULDN'T be frustrated at that.
23:19:33<Kita> But giving into your weakness puts you out of commission for forever.
23:19:41<Laevos> yes but
23:19:45<Laevos> how do I fix myself...?
23:20:02<Kita> Dote less on your weakness.
23:20:16<Laevos> mew? x_x
23:20:32<Kita> You're not weak because you attempted suicide. You're strong because you defied the attempt.
23:20:42<Laevos> that's all well and good but
23:20:52<Laevos> I'm more interested in trying to make sure I don't try again
23:20:57<Laevos> and don't get this low anymore...
23:21:15<Kita> Was it easier to stop, this time?
23:21:37<Laevos> that's the worst and hardest it's been in a long time...
23:21:52<Kita> What happened yesterday?
23:22:31<Laevos> just realizing how little I've done, how much I have to do, how I have no idea what I'm doing... basicallyI fell harder into a depressive episode than I have for a long time
23:23:00<Kita> Babe...
23:23:13<Kita> It isn't about how much you do.
23:23:17<Kita> It is about how well it is done.
23:23:36<Laevos> the quality of what I've done has been pretty shit too, tbh
23:23:38<Kita> Focus less on quantity. If you focus on quality, it gets done in time.
23:23:40<Laevos> but that won't cure my depression x_x
23:24:03<Kita> If you do things you're proud of, that will go a long way.
23:24:12<Kita> Medicine would, too... >>
23:25:08<Kita> Also, if your depression stems from gender dysphoria...
23:25:15<Kita> Then transition would go a long way, too.
23:26:01<Laevos> I don't know if it does
23:26:26<Laevos> I really don't
23:26:30<Kita> Then maybe you should dedicate more thought to the idea.
23:26:48<Laevos> maybe I do need medicine
23:26:51<Laevos> but I can't do it alone
23:26:55<Laevos> and don't say I'm not
23:27:00<Laevos> because I mean I would need someone physically here
23:27:20<Kita> At all times?
23:27:31<Kita> Kita is everything but physically there...
23:27:38<Laevos> Lilith knows
23:27:44<Laevos> and doesn't love Kita any less for that
23:27:48<Laevos> but yes...
23:31:49<Kita> Get over that, first.
23:32:02<Kita> Then everything will be much, much easier.
23:33:09<Laevos> x~x
23:33:12<Laevos> okay
23:34:16<Laevos> "I have an immobile monolith of psychological and physical need." "Oh, well get over that and you'll be set"
23:34:23<Laevos> not really... even remotely helpful, sorry...

00:23:51<Kita> Well... Kita doesn't have an answer without a cause.
00:24:02<Laevos> mew ;-;
00:24:07<Kita> WHY are you emotionally dependant upon others.
00:24:18<Kita> That is a very important question.
00:25:20<Laevos> I don't know how to not be ;-;
00:25:26<Kita> (Also, if you describe it as a mountain, then getting to the summit and down the other side is exactly what to do.)
00:26:16<Kita> Somewhere along the line, you were developmentally stunted.
00:26:20<Laevos> so just pull myself up by my bootstraps or?
00:26:27<Kita> Nono.
00:26:32<Kita> Nothing like that.
00:26:40<Kita> You must be taught to climb a mountain.
00:26:45<Kita> You can't just do it.
00:27:01<Kita> So we have to teach you independance.
00:30:38<Laevos> mrgh
00:30:41<Laevos> don't want to be independent
00:34:07<Kita> Independance is the key to being better.
00:34:39<Laevos> what makes you say that...?
00:38:17 Kita: rubs Lilith's chin.
00:38:30<Kita> It is empowering
00:41:14<Laevos> mew...
00:41:21<Laevos> maybe for you
00:41:27<Laevos> but I would never want to be independent...
00:43:58<Kita> Independant =! Alone
00:44:13<Kita> It just means that while others are nice, you get to choose whether or not they are there.
00:44:25<Kita> That way you can have all the nice people, and none of the shitty ones.
00:44:28<Kita> <3
00:47:36<Laevos> I don't know if I want to do that...
00:48:15<Kita> Why? Shitty people are shitty.
00:48:24<Kita> You shouldn't need them.
00:48:35<Kita> You shouldn't even want them.
00:49:51<Laevos> that doesn't really have anything to do with my problem, though...
00:51:10<Kita> Maybe it does.
00:51:36<Kita> You cling to your meatspace friends... But Kita hasn't heard a lot of things that would make her want to hang out with them, regularly.
00:54:15<Laevos> they're the only people that I can hang out with?
00:54:32<Laevos> the only local friends I have?
00:54:46<Kita> Independance allows you to move past them.
00:54:50<Kita> Make new friends.
00:55:35<Laevos> I mean it'd be cool if I could just do that
00:55:39<Laevos> but that's not really how anything works...
00:55:47<Kita> Yet.
00:59:05<Laevos> how do you propose I become able to make friends?
00:59:10<Laevos> And what do you suggest I do in the meantime...?
00:59:44<Kita> Kita and Lilith will work on confidence and presence.
00:59:48<Kita> As well as humour.
00:59:59<Kita> (Lilith is funny, she just doesn't know it, yet.)
01:00:06<Kita> And in the meantime...
01:00:39<Kita> Daily conversations with your goddess. Mandatory cuddling. 1000 years. No trial.
01:00:43<Kita> <3
01:01:07<Laevos> <3 ;n;
01:01:11<Laevos> I wish I could have cuddling
01:01:56<Kita> Lilith should also stop shunning things that make socialisation easier.
01:02:06<Laevos> Like? Q_Q
01:02:58<Kita> Bars.
01:03:04<Laevos> mew x_x
01:03:05<Kita> Meetings.
01:03:09<Laevos> bars are disgusting
01:03:11<Kita> Social clubs.
01:03:17<Laevos> dunno
01:03:20<Laevos> I was at a convention last weekend
01:03:20<Kita> Many bars are very clean.
01:03:26<Laevos> I mean because of the alcohol
01:03:33<Laevos> the loudness
01:03:39<Laevos> the presence of triggering drunk people.
01:04:01<Kita> If people are getting drunk in a bar, they aren't in a bar the right way.
01:04:33<Kita> (Bars are for socialising, not drinking alcohol. Alcohol is just something a lot of people bond over, that is all.)
01:04:47<Laevos> I can't claim to know or care what the proper way to be in a bar is
01:04:54<Laevos> I can only speak from experience of what I've seen.

01:17:50<Kita> You connected with Kita.
01:17:53<Kita> You're capable.
01:18:00<Laevos> on IRC...
01:18:09<Laevos> haven't made friends in person for about eight years now
01:19:24<Kita> You made friends without the things that make face-to-face interactions more personable and gauge-able.
01:19:39<Laevos> no... it's far easier online
01:20:10<Laevos> I just want to be touched right now
01:20:19<Laevos> so I'm on Craigslist looking to endanger myself again
01:20:31<Kita> Close that tab.
01:21:18<Laevos> mewmew...
01:21:32<Kita> You're a human being.
01:21:39<Laevos> and...?
01:21:43<Kita> You are not a toy for someone to play with.
01:22:13<Laevos> if it'd give me physical interaction...
01:22:25<Kita> Nuh hunh.
01:22:51<Kita> You really don't want that kind of interaction.
01:23:06<Laevos> at this point I'll take whatever I can get...
01:23:06<Kita> That kind of interaction is what makes you hate yourself in the first place.
01:24:23<Kita> Lilith.
01:26:16<Laevos> Kita...?
01:26:32 Kita: points to her lap.
01:26:35<Kita> Here.
01:26:39 Laevos: curls up...
01:26:46 Kita: pets, lightly.
01:27:32 Laevos: starts to cry a bit
01:27:49<Kita> Hun, you'll survive the night.
01:28:11<Laevos> I closed the tab
01:28:12<Laevos> happy?
01:28:18<Kita> Yes.
01:28:28<Laevos> surviving seems like the worse option at this point
01:28:32 Kita: kisses her cheek.
01:29:02<Kita> Lilith, you shouldn't view it so negatively.
01:29:38<Kita> You made the decision to not endanger yourself over an unhealthy obsession... And it is unhealthy. You were willing to endanger yourself to scratch the itch.
01:30:17<Laevos> I'd do anything not to be alone...
01:30:49<Kita> You're not alone. You really aren't.
01:30:59<Laevos> I am... I need physical contact...
01:31:05<Kita> Want Kita to leave for an hour and prove that it would be way worse without here?
01:31:29<Laevos> not saying it couldn't be any worse x_x just that it's unbearable as it is...
01:31:53<Kita> Think of it like an addiction.
01:32:04<Kita> The more you feed it, the more you are submissive to it.
01:32:24<Kita> Your need for physical contact is the heroin of a junkie.
01:32:43<Kita> If you can make it through the withdrawals... You'll be FREE.
01:32:47<Laevos> it's a basic emotional human need..
01:32:59<Kita> In doses.
01:33:18<Laevos> and I've had none for quite a long while...
01:33:21<Kita> Water is a basic physical need... Without it, you WILL die...
01:33:30<Kita> But too much can kill you.
01:33:55<Laevos> I should still be able to have more than none...
01:34:08<Kita> You are having more than none, right now.
01:34:12<Kita> You have contact.
01:34:24<Kita> It may not be physical, but it is still contact.
01:34:26<Laevos> not the kind that will help me...
01:35:13<Kita> You made the right choice, tonight.
01:35:25<Kita> You may not think it, but you did.
01:35:27<Kita> :<
01:36:01<Laevos> I really want to kill myself right now
01:36:26<Kita> You're not going to.
01:37:06<Laevos> kay
01:37:25 Kita: hugs close and tight and grooms on.
01:37:40<Laevos> it doesn't help... I can't do this on my own...
01:38:16<Kita> Good thing you're not on your own.
01:38:39<Laevos> I am... there's nobody else here
01:38:49<Laevos> and no matter how many times you say otherwise, that isn't going to change...
01:39:12<Kita> Then should Kita go?
01:39:42<Laevos> if you want, it's what I deserve...
01:40:07<Kita> No one can decide what they, themselves deserve.
01:40:22<Kita> There is always bias.
01:40:29<Laevos> okay
01:40:47<Kita> Do you disagree?
01:41:45<Laevos> no opinion...
01:41:52<Laevos> just hurting a lot right now
01:42:19<Kita> Hurt isn't good, but hurt is always better than dead.
01:42:53<Laevos> thanks, I'm sure that knowledge will cheer me right up
01:46:10<Laevos> I just wish someone were here to comfort me...
01:46:18<Laevos> the friends that I have don't do that
01:46:21<Laevos> nobody does that...
01:47:01 Kita: growls.
01:47:17<Laevos> not _here_
01:47:24<Kita> You don't want comfort. You want to wallow.
01:47:49<Laevos> mm, maybe so...
01:47:59<Kita> Then be honest about it.
01:48:08<Laevos> I don't know what I want
01:48:16<Laevos> besides knowing that I don't want to be alone...
01:52:13<Kita> What is so bad about being alone.
01:52:23<Laevos> it hurts
01:52:26<Laevos> it causes me pain

13:21:57<Kita> Irritated,  but not at you, sweetie.
13:22:12<Laevos> Awwh, at what? ;n;
13:22:54<Kita> Detroit elites want to privatise water.
13:23:06<Laevos> @_@
13:23:25<Laevos> Worst evar
13:23:27<Laevos> 0/10
13:24:27<Kita> Kita thinks we should take all people who want to privatise water, line them up in a staggered formation, so that when they lean forward, all their heads line up...
13:24:49<Kita> And then we see how many rounds from a high-powered sniper rifle it takes to drop all of them. >>
13:24:56<Laevos> ;n;

11:43:24<Laevos> Beep boop
11:43:43<Kita> Biddley-boop
11:43:57<Kita> [09:16:08] <~Kita> So
11:43:57<Kita> [09:16:50] <~Kita> If you hover the "hand" in Pokemon-Amie in empty space, eventually the Pokemon will attempt to high-five, headbutt, or some other thing to the hand.
11:43:57<Kita> [09:16:56] <~Kita> Dratini bumps its nose.
11:43:57<Kita> [09:16:57] <~Kita> <3
11:44:12<Laevos> What is that, anyway?
11:44:18<Laevos> Pokemon-Amie
11:44:33<Kita> Like, the best feature in X&Y.
11:44:35<Laevos> I've heard people... complaining about it, I guess?
11:44:48<Laevos> tell me more ouo
11:44:49<Kita> People may bitch, but the bitching is unwarranted.
11:45:08<Kita> Pokemon-Amie is a way for you to interact with your Pokemon.
11:45:26<Kita> You can pet them, feed them PokePuffs, and play cute little games with them.
11:46:01<Kita> All of these things increase their Affection, which is a different hidden stat from Friendship.
11:46:23<Kita> Maxed out affection gives neato benefits, inside the main game...
11:47:03<Kita> Boosted EXP, Crit Chance Boost, Chance to Endure hits, Chance to just shake off status effects, Resistance to attract status...
11:47:12<Laevos> Yay :3
11:47:25<Kita> Is good stuff.
11:50:07<Laevos> Sounds like it! Someone said it was the only way to get a Sylveon? :o
11:50:15<Laevos> Besides trading obv
11:50:40<Kita> Sylveon evolves from Eevee when Eevee is maxed Affection'd AND has a Fairy move.
11:51:15<Laevos> Oh okay
11:51:37<Laevos> Still waiting for Ghost-type Eeveelution
11:51:46<Laevos> from when it dies ;-;
11:52:41 Kita: is waiting for Draconeon.

23:26:27 Kita: creates.. MELOPROG
23:26:59<Kita> Like melodeath, except prog.
23:27:38<Kita> So
23:27:46<Kita> What does Lilith think of djent?
23:27:48<Laevos> We set out to create the world's strongest Pokemon... and we succeeded.
23:28:12<Laevos> Don't enjoy it
23:29:13 Kita: doesn't either, though some of her friends are surprised by this.
23:29:26<Laevos> I'm not, really
23:29:30<Laevos> it's darpy xux
23:29:36<Kita> Symphonic, Power, Prog, and some dabbling in Death.
23:29:42<Kita> That is what Kita likes.
23:29:51<Laevos> :3
23:29:59<Laevos> which DEFF MEHTUL bands?
23:30:06<Kita> None specifically.
23:30:11<Laevos> no old people stuff? ;o
23:30:25<Kita> Just songs... And none that Kita can name off the tip of her tongue.
23:30:41<Kita> It is why Kita said dabbling.
23:30:44<Laevos> I'm okay with some metal of death
23:31:02<Kita> It really is just "Oh hey... random death metal piece... This one isn't bad."
23:31:02<Laevos> if you wanna explore together, just let me know bby ;u;
23:31:18<Laevos> though the stuff I likke is mostly from the '90s
23:31:25<Laevos> as far as DM goes
23:31:57<Kita> Kita is definitely much more of an Aughts fan, in general... Though some Nineties music has reached its way into her collection.
23:32:38<Laevos> I have more contemporary black metal than 90s stuff
23:32:45 Kita: nods.
23:32:53<Laevos> but it's the reverse for death
23:32:58<Kita> Yeah.
23:33:16<Kita> Does Lilith ever listen to classical or neoclassical?
23:33:19<Laevos> I dunno, I don't really care for the directions the genre seems to have taken
23:33:23<Laevos> umm
23:33:33<Laevos> the closest thing I listen to those is like
23:33:40<Laevos> dungeon synth? xD
23:33:51 Kita: nods.
23:33:52<Laevos> I listen to classical for my music class :P
23:34:08 Kita: doesn't have much of a taste for specific composers, but pieces.
23:34:26<Laevos> I know the names of a few classical pieces
23:34:36 Kita: also really digs industrial techno.
23:34:36<Laevos> mostly really obvious ones ;P
23:35:07<Laevos> I like industrial! Again, though, mostly older stuff... 80s as far as that goes xD
23:35:15<Kita> :3
23:35:19<Kita> Lilith should share.
23:35:32<Laevos> Okay!
23:35:56 Kita: also likes music that implies non-instruments being used as instruments.
23:36:21<Kita> Like disc drives.
23:36:22<Kita> :3
23:37:46<Laevos> Yeah, I like those floppy songs
23:37:48<Laevos> the Ghostbusters one was neato
23:38:27<Kita> Through the Fire and Flames, though Cry For Eternity or The Flame of Youth would have been better choices from that album.
23:38:42<Kita> Someone should do Seasons or The Game on Floppy.
23:38:42<Kita> :3
23:38:54<Laevos> lol
23:39:00<Kita> Those are superior DragonForce songs.
23:39:02<Kita> Just saying.
23:39:08<Kita> TTFAF is like... the bottom level.
23:39:14<Kita> They have much better songs.
23:39:53<Laevos> but would they be better floppy songs?
23:40:00<Laevos> think about it
23:40:11<Kita> Very much so.
23:40:22<Kita> Especially The Game.
23:40:28<Laevos> well okay then!
23:40:41<Laevos> so
23:40:51<Kita> Lower pitches, faster chugs, less splitting of the rhythm and lead guitar.
23:41:00<Kita> Would sound much better on floppy
23:41:08<Laevos> 400+ tapes weigh quite a lot QnQ
23:41:14<Kita> o.o
23:41:19<Laevos> and fair enough!
23:41:31<Laevos> I got all of my tapes boxed up
23:41:35<Laevos>  to move out
23:41:42<Kita> o.o
23:41:46<Kita> Why tapes
23:42:04<Laevos> because I own them
23:42:15<Laevos> and my CDs are already boxed up
23:42:21<Laevos> I never unpacked them xux
23:42:25<Kita> Well... Yes... but... Why do you own tapes
23:42:26<Kita> o.o
23:42:57<Laevos> Like, can we ever really own anything?
23:43:05<Kita> Yes, yes we can.
23:43:20<Kita> Ownership is a temporary thing.
23:43:24<Laevos> Or are we the ones that, like, Nature owns
23:43:26<Laevos> li
23:43:29<Laevos> maaaan
23:43:33<Kita> :P
23:43:51<Kita> You sure you don't wanna try edibles with Kita, at least once?
23:44:13<Laevos> Pretty sure xux
23:44:34<Kita> "Hey man... want a Leaf Stone...?"
23:44:34<Laevos> I do wanna lick Kita's cute face all over though
23:44:40<Kita> "L...lombre...?"
23:44:41<Laevos> Hehehehehe xD
23:44:49<Kita> "Yeah... Take a Leaf Stone, brooooo..."
23:45:02<Kita> "...Lo...Lom...Lu...Ludicoooooloooooo...."
23:45:07<Kita> Remember kids.
23:45:12<Kita> Don't do Leaf Stones.
23:45:24<Kita> It turns you into a Mexican Pineapple Duck.
23:45:25<Laevos> Remember kids
23:45:46<Laevos> stay out of your dad's Leaf Stones, goddamn it
23:46:05<Kita> Lilith
23:46:13<Kita> Would you be the mother of Kita's children
23:46:19<Laevos> yes
23:46:25<Kita> Too bad.
23:46:29<Kita> Never having kids.
23:46:31 Kita: petpats.
23:46:35<Laevos> me neither :D
23:46:38<Laevos> but
23:47:10<Laevos> I would mother them
23:47:12<Laevos> Mother 2
23:47:16<Laevos> or 3
23:47:36<Kita> Would you make them
23:47:39<Kita> Earthbound
23:47:58<Laevos> I guess
23:48:08<Laevos> is the alternative launching them into space?
23:48:15<Kita> No.
23:48:20<Kita> Launching them into the core.
23:48:27<Kita> Of the Earth.
23:48:33<Kita> Via volcanic injection.
23:48:35<Laevos> that sounds expensive as emerald-encrusted poop
23:48:37<Laevos> oh
23:48:39<Laevos> that works
23:48:48<Kita> WELCOME TO THE WORLD
23:49:00<Kita> EXTERNAL VOLCANO-BASED ABORTION
23:49:28<Laevos> Finally, a birth control option that we can all agree on
23:50:22<Kita> Also
23:50:32<Kita> A bitchin' name for a political death metal song.
23:50:43 Kita: would listen to it.
23:50:50<Laevos> yeah
23:51:03<Laevos> me too xux
23:51:15<Kita> CATTLE DECAPITATION'S FORCED GENDER REASSIGNMENT
23:51:18<Laevos> if you impregnate me, that's what I'm getting
23:51:25<Laevos> I never watched that video
23:51:32<Laevos> or even listened to the song
23:51:39<Laevos> apparently it was
23:51:50<Laevos> ~extreme~
23:51:50<Kita> THE SONG ABOUT TAKING WESTBORO BAPTIST CHURCH MEMBERS GETTING DISMEMBERED INTO THE OPPOSITE SEXES.
23:52:00<Laevos> lolol
23:52:02<Laevos> yes
23:52:21<Laevos> Cattle Decapitation certainly have their hearts in the right places
23:52:44<Laevos> never got into their style, though
23:53:40<Laevos> the militant veganism thing isn't really my cup of tea, either, honestly
23:53:59<Laevos> I can appreciate the sentiment behind it
23:54:36<Laevos> and animal cruelty in factories and whatnot should certainly be ended
23:55:10<Laevos> but, while I don't particularly find meat to be my favorite food, its a necessity for a good many people
23:56:39<Laevos> Plus, if my Goddess wants me to feed her some steaks, sorry cows, I'm feeding her some goddamn steaks Q/////Q

00:06:55<Kita> <3
00:07:04<Kita> So
00:07:16<Kita> Funny thing about veganism..
00:07:25<Kita> It kind of doesn't work.
00:07:42<Kita> Like sure, if you're diligent about supplements, then okay... You might be able to do it...
00:08:16<Kita> But, if you haven't noticed? Vegans are either fat, because they eat too many carbs because they are hungry all the time and don't get enough protein to compensate...
00:08:22<Kita> Or they are fucking scrawny.
00:08:40<Kita> Kita is fat because she overeats.
00:09:01<Kita> But Kita can also push a fucking car.
00:09:10<Laevos> She can?
00:09:14<Kita> Yes.
00:09:27<Kita> These legs are fucking strong from hefting her fat ass everywhere.
00:09:32<Laevos> Oh Goddess~ ^^
00:10:00<Kita> It doesn't show
00:10:02<Kita> But it is there.
00:10:24 Laevos: licks Kita's legs lovingly xux
00:10:50<Kita> x3
00:10:57<Kita> So
00:11:19<Kita> Kita thinks that veganism is inherently a weakener.
00:12:41<Kita> And that instead of going to the extreme, at least, until it is no longer a detriment, you should minimise the negative impact of the current practice.
00:12:45<Laevos> Lilith could probably be a vegetarian and not miss anything
00:12:50<Laevos> vegan? dunno
00:12:56<Kita> Vegetarian, sure, not vegan.
00:13:30<Kita> Vegans can't have ANYTHING derived from animals, and certain amino acids and protein chains have yet to be mass produced in supplment form, so they miss out.
00:13:36<Kita> supplement*
00:13:51<Laevos> I don't actually k ow any vegans
00:13:56<Laevos> err
00:13:56<Kita> Yeah.
00:13:58<Laevos> know
00:14:00<Laevos> IRL
00:14:02<Kita> Because they are annoying as shit.
00:14:19<Kita> They scoff if you order a hamburger.
00:14:34<Laevos> i lov vegebrgr
00:14:34<Kita> They pipe up if you offer to make dinner.
00:14:55<Laevos> the one they have at Cheesecake Factory is good xD
00:15:00<Kita> How do you know you've invited a vegan? Don't worry, they'll tell you.
00:15:24<Kita> Vegan food is fucking hard to cook.
00:15:34<Laevos> I tried
00:15:49<Kita> You can't even use BUTTER.
00:15:53<Laevos> with my partner in the UK
00:15:57<Laevos> to make a vegan cheesecake
00:15:57<Laevos> we fucking failed omg
00:16:00<Laevos> it was fun, but
00:16:15<Laevos> didn't make anything that one could remotely call a cheesecake
00:16:17 Kita: growls at her recipe book for vegans.
00:16:29<Kita> Kita no longer invites vegans.
00:16:51<Laevos> I don't like butter xux
00:17:22<Kita> Sure, but you use it for texture and consistency in things a lot more than you do for flavour.
00:17:27<Kita> You use butter in cookies.
00:17:35<Kita> Cookies don't taste like butter.
00:17:51<Laevos> I don't really eat cookies xwx
00:18:00<Kita> You'll eat Kita's cookies.
00:18:06<Kita> Kita makes the best cookies.
00:18:07<Kita> ;.;
00:18:08<Laevos> Yes ma'am!
00:18:24<Kita> You HAVE to wait for them to cool...
00:18:31<Kita> They fall apart if you don't.
00:18:37<Kita> Because they are so gooey.
00:18:49<Kita> (Her chocolate chip cookies.)
00:19:08<Kita> Also, Kita chunks a brick of chocolate, instead of using chips.
00:19:18<Kita> So they are really chocolate chunk cookies.
00:19:45<Kita> Kita also makes mint&butterscotch fudge
00:20:13<Laevos> know what else Kita makes?
00:20:20<Laevos> Melted Lilith heart xux
00:20:23<Kita> X3
00:21:00 Kita: makes spicy jalapeno scones to go with her fancy italian sodas.
00:21:16<Laevos> yummy ;u;
00:26:39<Kita> Does Lilith like Italian sodas?
00:28:59<Laevos> never tried one
00:29:35<Kita> It is basically Torani's syrup
00:29:38<Kita> In soda water
00:30:07<Kita> And Torani's syrup is just a flavour enhancer for coffee and vodka.
00:31:05<Laevos> doesn't sound like something I'd enjoy ;n;
00:31:54<Kita> Well
00:32:00<Kita> Do you like soda water?
00:33:46<Laevos> yes
00:33:55<Kita> Okay
00:33:56<Laevos> soda WATER
00:34:00<Laevos> not soda syrup xux
00:34:04<Kita> Imagine it LIGHTLY flavoured
00:34:07<Kita> Just a little bit
00:34:11<Kita> with like
00:34:16<Kita> cherry or vanilla or something

00:40:51<Laevos> I've tried that
00:40:55<Laevos> and it's... bad
00:41:03<Laevos> not to my taste, I should say
00:41:20<Kita> Oh.
00:41:34 Kita: shrugs. Prefers it to regular soda.
00:41:56<Kita> So
00:42:15<Kita> Kita is still grinding the E4 for exp in Pokemon Y to evolve Pokemon.
00:42:37<Kita> She goes into the first battle...
00:42:47<Kita> Evolves three of the Pokemon with her.
00:42:58<Kita> Two into final stage, last into needs a stone...
00:44:01<Kita> The fourth Pokemon she brought with her does not evolve the way she thought it did
00:44:09<Kita> Wasted E4 run
00:47:53<Kita> Kiss to make Kita feel better?
00:47:54<Kita> Her lips taste like mint.
00:49:05 Laevos: kisses Kita softly
00:49:10<Laevos> kisses
00:49:19<Laevos> love you, Goddess! ;/////;
00:49:26<Kita> Love you, too.
00:49:50<Laevos> sorry that didn't go well Dx
00:51:10<Kita> "GREETINGS PUNY MORTAL. I AM BARBARACLE, EMISSARY OF THE DAMNED, AND DESTROYER OF NATIONS."
00:51:24<Kita> "Hi, Barbaracle. This is Fig Newton."
00:51:38<Kita> "HOW DARE A PUNY CREATURE SUCH AS THAT STAND BEF-"
00:51:46<Kita> "Needle Arm, Fig Newton."
00:51:58<Kita> "NO! MY ONLY WEAKNESS! GRASS!"
00:52:29<Laevos> xDD
00:53:21<Kita> Water/Rock is such a vulnerable typing.
00:53:33<Laevos> it is
00:53:39<Kita> There is a reason Kabutops and Omastar aren't used a lot more than they are.
00:53:52<Kita> Both of them are pretty vulnerable to fast, Special Sweepers...
00:54:02<Kita> And a LOT of those learn Energy Ball.
00:59:19<Laevos> Yeah QnQ
01:00:56<Kita> There is one Psychic-type that is immune to Ghost-type moves.
01:01:00<Kita> Can you name it?
01:01:09<Kita> This is an open-book test.
01:01:09<Kita> <3
01:04:58<Laevos> hmm
01:05:04<Kita> If you need a hint, you can ask.
01:05:40<Laevos> one species of Pokemon, or one specific Pokemon?
01:05:41<Laevos> also
01:05:41<Laevos> I know what it is
01:05:50<Laevos> Giraffarig, however it's spelled
01:05:59<Kita> Girafarig is correct.
01:06:09<Kita> Psychic/Normal.
01:06:15<Kita> Too bad its stats suck shit.
01:06:19<Laevos> Hehehehe xD
01:06:25<Laevos> at least it's...
01:06:31<Laevos> a giraffe
01:06:33<Kita> Otherwise it would be useful on Mono-Psychic.
01:06:37<Kita> So
01:06:41<Laevos> it's got that going for it
01:06:59<Kita> There were TWO Gen II Pokemon released that had faces on their tails.
01:07:08<Kita> Girafarig and Wobbuffett.
01:07:39<Laevos> this is true
01:07:41<Kita> Wobbuffett itself is actually the tail. The blue part is just a distraction to protect itself.
01:07:52<Laevos> o::::
01:09:06<Kita> This is why its main moves are Mirror Coat, Counter, Safeguard, and Encore/Splash/Destiny Bond.
01:09:23<Laevos> yeah
01:09:27<Laevos> splash omg
01:09:30<Kita> yes.
01:09:38<Kita> Wynauts are born with Splash.
01:09:45<Laevos> that's great
01:09:49<Kita> Oh. It can have Charm, too.
01:10:09<Kita> So like, Wobbuffet is a great Physical Counter.
01:10:23<Kita> Safeguard, Charm, Counter, Encore.
01:10:49<Kita> Encore can be replaced with Mirror Coat.
01:10:51<Kita> See
01:11:04<Kita> Wobbuffet is great in competitive, where shit is super predictable.
01:11:42<Laevos> yeah
01:11:44<Laevos> xux
01:11:53<Kita> There are very few mixed sweepers left.
01:11:59<Kita> Lucario
01:12:02<Kita> Greninja
01:12:05<Kita> Mewtwo
01:12:13<Kita> Deoxys
01:12:27<Kita> Charizard, Kita supposes.
01:12:40<Kita> (Though Charizard Y is more popular.)
01:13:19<Kita> Charizard Y sees something like... 60% usage, Charizard X gets maybe 25?
01:13:30<Laevos> well, that was horrifying
01:13:39<Kita> ?
01:13:44<Laevos> Lilith just hallucinated spiders all over herself
01:13:49<Laevos> it was just her hair
01:14:14<Kita> Babe...
01:14:19 Kita: offers her paws.

20:56:13<Laevos> I haven't made a triples team yet
20:56:15<Laevos> just doing random
20:56:37<Kita> You need Worry Seed. It turns the target's ability to Insomnia... And if the opponent brings out something with Mold Breaker, in response...
20:56:44<Kita> You're going to be glad you had it.
20:57:29<Laevos> Yes
20:57:38<Kita> You can use the first turn Mat Block to entrain Sturdy onto a Mold Breaker Pokemon. Focus Sash the Shedinja, just in case of that.

02:11:15<Kita> Kita's paws are sore.
02:11:16<Kita> :<
02:11:55<Laevos> Mew! Dx
02:12:16 Laevos: takes the Kitapaws and gently starts massaging them, nuzzling one after another <3 ;-;
02:12:32<Kita> o.o
02:12:41<Kita> Mmmm....
02:13:02<Kita> Good kitty. The nuzzling is unneccessary on the footpaws... But cute.
02:13:26<Laevos> Lilith figured that it might not do much, but... likes feeling close to her Goddess
02:13:46 Laevos: continues to gently rub at, massaging the soreness and ache out of her beautiful paws
02:14:09<Kita> There is no harm in that. <3

18:44:03<Laevos> Eep x_x
18:44:06<Laevos> Which torrent? Dx
18:44:10<Kita> Gargoyles
18:44:26<Laevos> The animated series?
18:45:01<Kita> Yeah.
18:45:02<Kita> :<
18:45:22<Kita> Need a decent torrent with better than TVrip quality, and with some seeds...

19:37:12<Laevos> except season three doesn't seem to exist anywhere
19:37:14 Kita: head tilts.
19:37:22<Kita> Season three wasn't done right, anyway.
19:37:24<Kita> :<
19:37:28<Laevos> well then there you go
19:37:45<Kita> It is hard to tell if you're serious or joking, sweetie.
19:37:46<Kita> :<
19:37:56<Laevos> I'm not joking Q_Q
19:38:35<Laevos> though through Amazon it'd require me to know your address unless you have a wish list
19:38:46 Kita: rubs her chin.
19:38:52<Kita> Then no address for Lilith.
19:39:10<Kita> Because Kita could seriously just buy it herself if she REALLY cared that much.
19:39:25<Laevos> I really care Q_Q
19:39:30<Kita> It is a very sweet offer.
19:39:38<Laevos> (About Goddess, never really got into Gargoyles)
19:39:45<Laevos> (I was probably too little xwx)
19:40:04<Kita> The series has supposedly aged better than any other cartoon ever made.
19:40:09<Laevos> o:::::
19:40:19<Laevos> like a fine EZ cheez
19:40:42<Kita> Like... A lot of people regard the series as better now than when they were kids, because they understand all the references.
19:40:44<Kita> AND the cunning of Xanatos.
19:41:42<Laevos> :3
19:41:48<Kita> (There is a reason it is named the Xanatos Gambit)
19:43:06<Laevos> the Kita Gambit QuQ
19:44:38<Kita> ...You mean... When Kita has the decision of being fed a meal or eating a meal, herself?
19:46:21<Laevos> Yes definitely ;u;

21:04:06<Kita> o.o
21:07:35 Laevos: licks
21:07:53<Kita> So here is a good question...
21:08:05<Kita> But first, a less good question
21:08:09<Kita> Is Lilith a troper?
21:08:17<Laevos> No
21:08:21<Laevos> that site is icky ~u~
21:08:22<Kita> :<
21:08:22<Kita> Oh.
21:08:27 Kita: huffs.
21:08:33<Laevos> Sowwie ;u;
21:09:03<Kita> It is a good way to quickly communicate certain story telling mechanics in a way that is concise and reasonable.
21:09:22<Laevos> I don't like the site ;u;
21:09:52<Kita> Would it be prying or inconsiderate to ask why?
21:11:40<Laevos> seems like a high concentration of annoying internets kids
21:11:48<Laevos> and calling every single thing that has ever existed a trope
21:12:02<Kita> :<
21:12:15<Kita> Kita holds that it has to appear more than once to be a trope.
21:12:26<Kita> Such as the Xanatos Gambit.
21:12:33<Kita> It happens a lot in fiction.
21:13:11<Kita> Some tropes are commonly referred to without know they are tropes (Big Bad, The Hero, Magnificent Bastard)
21:13:18<Kita> knowing*
21:13:23<Laevos> also
21:14:31<Laevos> it seems to lead to massive increases in the very annoying Typing Things in Title Caps Like They're Actually Proper Nouns or Titles When Actually Some Jackass Just Made a TVTropes Page That Happened to Have that Name.
21:14:38<Laevos> ...trend
21:14:50<Laevos> like... the names are so dumb
21:14:53<Laevos> that's another problem I have
21:14:56<Kita> Some of them, yes.
21:14:58<Laevos> SO dumb
21:15:30<Laevos> I have a problem with the whole Capitalizing Things For Emphasis thing in the first place, and that site seems to make it
21:15:33<Laevos> so much worse ~n~
21:15:47<Kita> Some of them are references to the work it was first executed in/best executed in/most obvious to the audience
21:15:53<Kita> Others are dumb.
21:16:02<Laevos> Those aren't mutually exclusive categories ~u~
21:16:09<Kita> Sure.
21:16:20<Kita> But Xanatos Gambit rolls off the tongue.
21:16:30<Laevos> Whatever you say ;w;
21:16:40<Kita> "Don't Break the Cutie" could be shortened to "Broken Cutie"
21:18:04<Kita> Some are references to historical figures (Morton's Fork)
21:18:25<Kita> Some of them are very literal (Opening Narration)
21:19:14<Kita> Card Carrying Villain could be renamed Actual Villain
21:19:22<Kita> And there would be no harm done.
21:19:33<Kita> But the tropes themselves are just a communication tool.
21:20:25<Kita> It is easier to say "Xanatos Gambit" than it is to say "That thing where the bad guy makes a plan that includes almost all possible outcomes, so that the heroes lose no matter what happens"
21:20:41<Laevos> Why is that a trope?
21:20:44<Laevos> That's just good planning
21:20:52<Laevos> I don't know, that's kind of the problem that I have with that site
21:20:56<Kita> It is a specific type of planning.
21:21:12<Kita> A type of planning that you can't really do in real life.
21:21:14<Laevos> it really seems to go overboard in terms of the boundaries of what's a trope (like, a fucking literary device) and what's... a thing that happens
21:22:07<Laevos> I dunno, "Thinking of everything" isn't really something that you can attribute to a primary source...
21:22:46<Kita> No... But the proper execution and reveal that they have thought of everything is more what it is about.
21:22:49<Laevos> it just seems really dumb, and I'm fine with people enjoying dumb/pointless things, but I don't really want any part of it
21:23:41<Kita> Not that Lilith is wrong... Just that Kita thinks there are other ways to look at it, and it might change her opinion if she was more open, or it might not.
21:24:06<Laevos> but... I don't really care about any of that kind of stuff
21:24:37<Kita> As someone who likes to write, Kita does like to know.
21:24:51<Laevos> there's not really any conceivable situation where I'd want to talk about "That thing where the bad guys show you they've thought of everything," much less under some silly pop-culture referency title.
21:25:15<Laevos> I like to write, and I could not care less about any of that :c
21:25:28<Laevos> Maybe I'd care if I wrote ~high art~ like fanfics. :P
21:25:32<Kita> Well... Sometimes it is interesting to muse over character motives in pieces of fiction.
21:25:37<Kita> Ugh.
21:25:43<Kita> Fanfics are almost all horrible.
21:25:46<Kita> almost.
21:25:58<Kita> There are notable exceptions, but they are few and far between.
21:27:09<Kita> Its like... People debate if Captain Jack Sparrow plans for everything in a flexible manner so that he may react and change his plan as he goes, or if he just makes it up as he goes, with very little planning at all.
21:27:33<Kita> Neither thing is particularly obvious in how the story is written... There is evidence for both. Both are amusing to think about.
21:28:16<Kita> Does he seem crazy because he is doing high-speed reactive planning on crack, or does he seem crazy because he is crazy.
21:29:00<Laevos> Can you use an example from a series that isn't terrible? :c
21:29:07<Kita> :P
21:29:08<Kita> Fine.
21:29:27<Kita> Spider-Man.
21:29:36<Kita> Does he plan, or does he wing it?
21:29:50<Laevos> I dunno
21:29:54<Laevos> he uses his spider senses
21:29:57<Laevos> and can jump around
21:30:15<Laevos> what more do you need? ;-;
21:30:28<Kita> He is more than that, though.
21:30:38<Laevos> true
21:30:41<Laevos> he is also Doc Ock

22:34:10<Kita> Fresh breath of air for superhero movies...
22:34:11<Kita> Unfortunately had to take a strange turn with the script because Kick-Ass was a British/Canadian endeavor trying to sell in America... so it needed a joke Americans would get...
22:34:11<Kita> And most Americans are unfamiliar with the term "call boy"
22:34:37<Kita> So they had to hit the low-hanging fruit with "gay" instead, though they handle the subject matter pretty tastefully, all thins considered.
22:34:50<Kita> Kick-Ass 2 is much better with that.
22:38:24<Laevos> oh okay
22:39:19<Kita> The director and the script writer had planned a whole series of jokes around the main character being a "call boy"
22:39:25<Kita> Which is a male prostitute.
22:39:28<Laevos> yes
22:39:35<Kita> In Britain and Canada...
22:39:46<Kita> These are actually common enough to be joked about regularly.
22:39:51<Kita> In America? Nope.
22:43:47<Laevos> Yeah
22:43:48<Laevos> not rly
22:44:07<Kita> It was a liiiittle too late for major changes though.
22:44:16<Laevos> So they kept it? o:
22:44:48<Kita> They changed all the jokes... a little bit... so that they would read write if they replaced "call boy" with "gay"
22:44:53<Laevos> oh okay
22:45:19<Kita> The director says in commentary that everyone was a little uncomfortable with it.
22:45:43<Kita> And that the joke still didn't quite fit...
22:45:50 Laevos: nods
22:46:19<Kita> In the second movie, it seems they avoided anything like that.
22:46:27 Kita: has seen both, but really likes them.
22:46:46<Kita> That bit in the first movie Kita doesn't like so much, but she understands why it was done.
22:51:34<Kita> But otherwise the movie is really good and captures a lot of the graphic novel without being to samey.
22:52:42<Laevos> :3
22:54:59<Kita> The two, the GN and the movies, are both good for different reasons...
22:55:09<Kita> But are feasibly two takes on the same story.
22:55:16<Kita> Its the right way to do it.
22:56:43 Laevos: nods

23:31:50<Laevos> working on a paper still
23:31:52<Laevos> or, a draft
23:31:55<Laevos> I got to put in a footnote
23:31:55<Kita> Topic?
23:31:57<Laevos> it made me happy
23:32:03<Laevos> talking about a German Dadaist poem
23:32:09<Kita> Oh.
23:32:14<Laevos> (It's for Poetry)
23:32:19<Kita> Dadaism is the most hilarious art movement ever
23:32:24<Laevos> #1 best art
23:32:25<Kita> Because it backfired horribly.
23:33:06<Kita> "We are going to prove that art should have an objective standard in some form, because the common people are stupid. We'll prove it by doing stupid, ridiculous shit, and calling it art."
23:33:32<Kita> Pfff...
23:33:51<Laevos> They set out to make the world's #1 best art
23:33:55<Laevos> ...and they succeeded TuT
23:34:15<Kita> No. They succeeded in doing the exact opposite.
23:34:15<Kita> As in...
23:34:59<Kita> They created the basest form of art imaginable, and then had it recognised as genius, when if a crazy person just did it because they were crazy... It would have totally been discredited as weird or not art.
23:35:28<Kita> Dadaism is the ironic, hipster teenage of art.
23:35:33<Kita> Doing it for the irony.
23:35:44<Kita> Make shitty art on purpose to criticise shitty art.
23:35:58<Kita> Then you have Poe's Dadaists...
23:36:21<Kita> Who make shitty art on purpose, and refuse all negative criticism of it, because you can't handle their GENIUS.

23:37:16<Kita> See
23:37:22<Kita> That's the problem.
23:37:37<Kita> And that was the original point of Dadaism.
23:38:01<Kita> And you have to admit... it is a totally valid point.
23:38:41<Kita> What separates the thing that the stressed out thirty year old did from what the carefree ten year old did, if not skill or message?
23:38:48<Kita> And not just message...
23:38:55<Kita> Perceivable message.
23:39:02<Kita> You have to be able to understand the message.

23:40:29<Kita> The only thing that can BE feminist is a person.
23:40:39<Laevos> it's a children's book

23:41:14<Laevos> I like this one the most
23:41:24<Kita> Kita has a problem when people try to teach things to kids that are WRONG.
23:41:36<Kita> Like... The orbital model of an atom.
23:41:43<Kita> We've known that is wrong since the fucking 60s.
23:41:49<Laevos> yeah but
23:41:55<Laevos> it's EZ to conceptualizeeeeee
23:42:00<Laevos> and shit
23:42:08<Kita> And you use it as a stepping stone.
23:42:45<Laevos> yeah
23:42:47<Laevos> as a children ~u~
23:42:55<Kita> You say "Up until whenever we used to think it looks like this. We don't think it looks like this anymore, but the reality is really complicated, so we'll use this to teach you concepts"
23:42:59<Kita> Just... word it for kids.
23:43:08<Kita> Kita doesn't know how to talk to kids.
23:43:14<Kita> Kids are smarter than you realise, though.
23:43:25<Laevos> I know bb
23:43:25<Kita> Negative numbers are easy to understand.
23:43:42<Laevos> I always talk to children like they're adults
23:43:47<Kita> In Kindergarten, Kita was "taught" subtraction.
23:43:59<Laevos> though you shouldn't do that to very young children because it's psychologically damaging ^u^
23:44:10<Kita> (Kita already had a pretty good grasp of the basic arithmatic)
23:44:58<Kita> They stated that you could not ever subtract a big number from a smaller number...
23:45:05<Kita> Which is BULLSHIT.
23:45:10<Laevos> lol
23:45:14<Kita> And is MOST of high school mathematics.
23:45:16<Laevos> they just wanted to fuck with you ;-;
23:45:25<Kita> Why is it most of high school mathematics?
23:45:33<Laevos> o_o most of high school math for me was calculus
23:45:41<Laevos> so I can't really comment
23:45:44<Kita> Lilith is a smart girl.
23:46:04<Laevos> I don't know what other math classes were like
23:46:18<Kita> Kita is a smart girl, too... But for most Americans, High School Math is Geometry, two years of Algebra, and maybe some Trig.
23:46:40<Laevos> yeah, that's what my siblings did, I think
23:46:43<Kita> So
23:46:49<Laevos> so yeah
23:46:51<Laevos> point taken
23:46:52<Laevos> :3
23:46:56<Kita> Yeah.
23:47:02<Laevos> anyway
23:47:08<Kita> The reason for this is because they have to UNTEACH shit.
23:47:17 Kita: throws her arms up.
23:47:19<Laevos> that "We Go to the Gallery" is more for disaffected mid 20 to mid 30-somethings than actual children, I think
23:47:31<Laevos> if you're actually reading that book to a child you're probz doing something wrong
23:47:37<Kita> :P
23:47:39<Laevos> or you're maybe a sociopath or something, I dunno
23:47:56<Laevos> like
23:48:05<Laevos> as a children's book it's not well organized at all
23:48:16<Laevos> the "new words" feel like they're completely drawn out of a hat
23:48:16<Kita> Yeah.
23:48:20<Kita> :P
23:48:32<Laevos> in what universe are you introducing "not" and "guilty" at the same time to a child's vocabulary?
23:48:46<Laevos> There needs to be some differentiation between simple negation and something like abstract nouns
23:48:46<Laevos> COME ON
23:48:50<Kita> X3
23:48:55 Kita: agress.
23:48:59<Kita> agrees*
23:49:06<Laevos> Ingress
23:49:16<Kita> Actually
23:49:20<Kita> Agress is a verb.
23:49:26<Laevos> I'll bet
23:49:29<Laevos> is it like egress?
23:49:31<Laevos> let's find out
23:49:33<Kita> And in that context would have been improperly conjugated.
23:49:50<Kita> It is no longer used. It is an archaic English verb.
23:49:51<Laevos> http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/agress
23:50:04<Laevos> I see
23:50:12<Laevos> nice
23:50:13<Laevos> I like that
23:50:14<Laevos> ~u~
23:50:32<Kita> Yeah..
23:50:43<Kita> Kita was also being dumb and misspelling it.
23:50:45<Kita> :P
23:51:26<Kita> But that was because she typed two s's instead of two e's
23:52:47<Laevos> oh that's fine

00:21:22<Kita> Ugh.
00:21:53<Kita> "Seriously, it isn't just religious people who are homophobic"
00:22:56<Kita> No. Only those influenced by religion are homophobic. If you aren't religious and you are homophobic, it is because you were part of a society where homophobia is either normal or expected. The only instances where that has been the case? Religious societies.
00:23:27<Kita> And if you're raised in a religious society, you are influenced by religion until you denounce your association and its stances.
00:24:34<Laevos> ;n;
00:24:59<Laevos> I unfortunately know some very homophobic atheists, but they're more or less just idiots in general.
00:25:21<Kita> You should ask them for a secular reason for homophobia.
00:25:34<Kita> Like... a logical reason to take the stance of homophobia.
00:25:42<Kita> (There isn't.)
00:25:44<Laevos> basically it comes down to "that's gross"
00:25:52<Kita> Then you say
00:26:16<Kita> "It is only as gross as regular sex. Prove me wrong."
00:26:44<Laevos> "Butts are where poop comes out of. Poop is gross. That's gross. QED."
00:26:55<Laevos> I mean
00:26:56<Kita> Not all gay sex is anal.
00:27:00<Laevos> I don't actually say any of that
00:27:05<Laevos> I just turn 360 degrees and walk away ~u~
00:27:17<Kita> No, but... You can really put them in a position.
00:27:23<Laevos> Some people are simply beyond re-education.
00:27:35<Kita> Kita likes to calmly explain logical fallacies until they get pissy while Kita remains calm.
00:27:47<Laevos> Having a more logically convincing stance doesn't do anything against someone with no firm grasp on logic.
00:28:00<Laevos> Generally people who hold such stupid views aren't smart enough to see why they're absurd.
00:28:08<Kita> It is never about the person who you are interacting with.
00:28:18<Kita> It is about the people who watch the interaction.
00:28:18<Kita> :3
00:28:27<Laevos> There's never anyone watching the interactions with these people
00:28:32<Laevos> they aren't online

00:28:59 Kita: nibbles on Lilith.
00:29:16<Laevos> omnomnomnom
00:29:37<Kita> Kita likes discussing proper philosophy in public.
00:30:41<Laevos> I try not to :c
00:30:50<Kita> why not?
00:30:56<Laevos> I don't like speaking.
00:31:03<Kita> Silly Lilith.
00:31:12<Laevos> Uguu~
00:31:22<Kita> Without speech, communication in person becomes hilariously ineffective.
00:31:23<Kita> <3
00:31:43<Laevos> I know
00:31:58<Laevos> I never said I was effective at communicating, though
00:32:15<Kita> Shouldn't it be a goal, though?
00:32:24<Kita> Communication is a useful tool!
00:32:43<Laevos> It should be... for some people
00:32:45<Laevos> I'll leave that up to them.
00:33:02<Laevos> I don't consider myself as someone who has much of anything to add to the global network of communication.
00:33:06<Laevos> At least in that way.
00:33:25<Kita> You're philosophically intelligent.
00:33:30<Kita> A little idealistic...
00:33:41<Kita> But certainly exercised in the thoughtschools.
00:33:51<Laevos> That may be true
00:34:06<Kita> You have value.
00:34:12<Laevos> but it doens't really affect my goals and desires when interacting with others.
00:34:18<Kita> Your opinions matter.
00:34:22<Laevos> It's frustrating, and I don't like doing it...

00:35:14<Kita> It would be much less frustrating once you had learned effective communication tactics.
00:35:31<Laevos> I don't really want to, though...
00:35:48<Kita> It would help with the loneliness problem.
00:36:13<Kita> Learning to talk to people would mean you have access to more people, which means less alone time.
00:36:36<Laevos> well talking to people is one thing, I don't want to make friends based on who will talk to me about things like philosophy
00:37:37<Kita> You would rather spend time with people you don't agree with on base issues?
00:37:58<Laevos> Whether I agree with them or not isn't really the issue, I just don't really care to discuss those kinds of things.
00:38:35<Kita> This is why Kita thinks Lilith's friends are assholes. :<
00:39:22 Laevos: shrugs
00:39:36<Laevos> the thing is
00:39:46<Laevos> I've met people who like talking about philosophical issues
00:39:48<Laevos> a lot
00:39:49<Laevos> and...
00:39:56<Laevos> they really try my patience, to be honest.
00:40:02<Kita> Kita is one of these people.
00:40:18<Laevos> You talk about other things, though
00:40:48<Laevos> so it balances out.
00:41:00<Kita> Sure, but philosophy is important to Kita. Kita is less idealistic, but her and Lilith are easily philosophically compatible.
00:43:07<Laevos> Another problem... I seem to have a pretty short fuse when discussing issues like that
00:43:30<Laevos> you're pretty good at taking my easily-provoked criticism and general bitchiness
00:43:35<Laevos> dunno how common of a trait that is
00:45:18<Kita> o.o
00:46:09<Laevos> I mean, unless you've secretly been deeply wounded whenever I blow up around you and just not told me ;n;

00:52:58<Kita> In lighter news
00:53:19<Kita> Kita has become excessively irritated at people who baselessly criticise Pokemon past Gen 1.
00:53:33<Kita> Kita is not a person who is really affected by nostalgia.
00:53:52<Kita> Just because Kita liked something in the past, does not save it from criticism in the future.
00:54:00<Laevos> yeah ;n;
00:54:14<Kita> Kita. Middle School. Shadow the Hedgehog. She played the shit out of that game. Loved it.
00:54:22<Kita> Realises now that it wasn't a good game.
00:54:42<Kita> But that is okay, and doesn't illegitimise the fun she had playing it.
00:54:58<Kita> Just means that she grew the fuck up, developed actual tastes, and moved the fuck on.
00:55:06<Kita> A lot more people need to fucking do that.
00:55:29<Laevos> ;u;
00:56:39<Kita> People who played first gen, maybe second gen, and then never again have no right to criticise sixth gen.
00:56:56<Kita> And sixth gen spits in their face.
00:56:57<Kita> >>
00:57:03<Kita> Hey
00:57:16<Kita> You weren't a Final Fantasy fan, right?
00:59:56<Laevos> Nope
01:00:03<Kita> Cool.
01:00:10<Kita> If you ever get that PS2...
01:00:21<Kita> You should hunt down a copy of Digital Devil Saga.
01:00:26<Laevos> o:
01:00:59<Kita> It is basically everything Final Fantasy isn't...
01:01:05<Kita> But it is still a JRPG.
01:02:45<Kita> (Also, FFI, FFVI, and FFX all stand out as notable exceptions for the quality of Final Fantasy games. FFVII is good, and certainly playable, but did not age well, and is overrated. Same with VIII and IX. II sucks. III is mediocre. IV is okayish. V is decent. XII sucks. XIII sucks.)
01:03:17<Kita> Digital Devil Saga is a Shin Megami Tensei game.
01:03:28<Laevos> My friend plays those
01:03:34<Kita> For the record... All Shin Megami Tensei games are good, or GREAT.
01:03:36<Laevos> apparently they're pretty difficult
01:03:39<Kita> Yeah.
01:03:40<Laevos> maybe?
01:03:46<Kita> They are also fucking hard.
01:04:04<Kita> Atlus has a tendency to publish difficult games.
01:04:19<Kita> But they aren't difficult like CoD tries to be, or like Minecraft tries to be.
01:05:08<Kita> They are legitimately hard. You fail because YOU fucked up. You missed the enemy telegraphing a move. You mistimed an attack. You accidentally healed the enemy because you didn't scan them first.
01:05:56<Kita> But it also rewards you for doing well.
01:06:05<Kita> extra turns for exploiting weaknesses
01:06:22<Kita> Stalling enemies by attacking in the right pattern
01:06:36<Kita> Bonus exp for low turn counts
01:06:52<Kita> Is good stuff.
01:07:01<Laevos> woop woop
01:07:21<Kita> Teaches you how to manage your turns and how to strategise on the fly.
01:07:35<Kita> Your characters also feel hilariously underpowered.
01:07:40<Laevos> My 3DS has gone untouched for a while
01:07:43<Kita> :<
01:07:46<Kita> You're busy.
01:07:49<Laevos> Maybe I'm just 2old 4video game
01:07:51<Kita> It is expected.
01:07:56<Kita> No. 2busy.
01:08:11<Laevos> I'm an old lady ;n;
01:08:17 Kita: rubs her nose.
01:08:22<Kita> You're also a more social gamer.
01:08:30<Kita> You game more when Kita talks to Lilith about games.
01:08:31<Kita> X3
01:08:36<Laevos> :3
01:08:38<Laevos> so tired
01:08:41<Kita> You game like a Japanese.
01:09:05<Kita> Kita games like a Finnish.

01:28:15<Kita> There is a subreddit called /r/DrunkOrAKid
01:28:25<Kita> A person posts a short summary title...
01:28:50<Kita> Then, using spoiler tags, posts whether they were drunk of a kid, and people guess in the comments.
01:29:15<Laevos> alright
01:29:37<Kita> If you guess right, you're supposed to be upvoted, if you guess wrong, downvoted. You're supposed to post your answer without looking at the other answers, or the spoiler tag in the main post.
01:29:47<Kita> Things like...
01:30:13<Kita> "Shoved a handful of snow into my coat pocket, because the snow "didn't belong to me" and I wanted to steal something."
01:30:44<Kita> "Started crying and apologising to the dog, after spilling orange juice in the air vent."
01:32:51<Kita> Guess, for both
01:32:54<Kita> Because humour

22:28:10<Kita> So
22:28:38<Kita> The point at which the music market became so saturated with shit and gold that it is impossible to identify it all.
22:28:57<Laevos> c'mon Kita
22:29:04<Kita> X3
22:29:16<Laevos> it's an academic music class, they don't talkk about commercial music :P
22:29:29<Kita> Ah.
22:29:29<Laevos> popular music, I should say
22:29:42<Laevos> it's all about "art music"
22:29:51<Laevos> so modernist and postmodernist, a lot of it
22:29:53<Kita> Eugh
22:29:57<Laevos> some chapters on film scores
22:30:10<Kita> "art music" just makes Kita recoil.
22:30:31<Laevos> by that, they mean
22:30:47<Laevos> classical, baroque, romantic, neoclassical,neoromantic, etc..
22:31:05<Kita> Ew. Ew. Meh. Meh. Ew.
22:31:21<Laevos> yeah
22:31:31<Laevos> I mean it's an academic music program
22:31:36<Laevos> what do you expect? :P
22:31:46<Kita> A little less pretentiousness.
22:31:50<Kita> Only a little.
22:32:12<Laevos> You're gonna be dissappointed, then
22:32:17<Laevos> sry bby
22:32:19<Laevos> bbly
22:32:30<Kita> Just a little less.
22:32:37<Kita> Kita didn't expect a complete lack.
22:32:40<Kita> Just a little less.
22:32:59<Kita> "What kind of music do you listen to, Laevos?"
22:33:12<Kita> "Black metal and Noise."
22:33:21<Laevos> it's an online class
22:33:24<Kita> Instafail
22:33:34<Laevos> though I did post some of that on the discussion boards
22:34:10<Laevos> the instructor seemed less full-of-pretense than the book :3
22:34:38<Kita> The problem with academic music classes is almost never the teachers.
22:34:44<Kita> T'is the fucking students.
22:34:56<Laevos> apparently she plays D&D, at least that's what she said in her introductory post, but she never answered when I asked her which edition
22:35:05<Laevos> well, I never had to interact with them :D
22:35:09<Kita> Good.

17:01:47<Laevos> regarding your comments on 'art music' the other day: my relatives on my dad's side were in town a few weeks ago, and my aunt was asking me what kinds of music I liked. She asked if I listened to any classical, I said no, and she was pretty surprised, but she said, "You'll grow to enjoy it as you get older." >_>
17:02:56<Kita> Not... really.
17:03:05<Kita> Classical is just... it has been done. Its boring.
17:03:16<Kita> Nowadays, it only works in a context...
17:03:20<Kita> Like a movie score.
17:03:24<Kita> And even then
17:03:32<Kita> Movie scores are kind of their own monster.
17:04:45<Laevos> Yeah, that was a silly comment on her part

01:09:01<Kita> :3
01:09:09<Laevos> Love you~ :3
01:10:13<Kita> Love you, too...
01:10:22<Kita> Had to take on the Armos Knight with just the sword.
01:10:22<Kita> ;.;
01:10:34<Kita> Fucking christ. That is a hard battle, with no arrows.
01:11:22<Laevos> ;-;
01:11:25<Laevos> Did you win? Q_Q
01:11:28<Kita> Yes.
01:11:33<Laevos> :3
01:11:36<Kita> Kita stabbed that bitch in the eyes.
01:11:46<Kita> (Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past)
01:11:50<Kita> IN THE EYES
01:12:05<Kita> HER SWORD CLEAVED FORTH THE CARVED STONE OF IT HUMAN-LIKE PUPILS
01:12:18<Kita> RENDERING IT BUT A STATUE ONCE MORE
01:13:38<Kita> AND FROM THE LAST STATUE, HER FIST PLUNGED INTO ITS CHEST, WHERE SHE PULLED FORTH THE JEWELLED HEART. FORSOOTH! SHE SMASHED THE JEWELLED BREAST TREASURE, INCORPORATING THE LIFEFORCE OF THE SIX STATUES INTO HER OWN, BEFORE CLUTCHING HER PRIZE, THE PENDANT OF POWER, FROM THE RUBBLE!
01:14:23<Kita> And there was much rejoicing, yay, for her sword remained as sharp has her piercing gaze.
01:14:28<Kita> >>
01:14:43 Kita: punches the Narrator, and dumps out her worthless green potion on his body.
01:16:14<Laevos> xux
01:16:39<Kita> o.o;
01:16:40<Kita> ?
01:16:50<Laevos> Sounds like
01:16:51<Laevos> an ordeal
01:18:19<Kita> It was.
01:18:23<Kita> So
01:18:36<Kita> The first boss in ALttP are the Armos Knights.
01:18:45<Kita> Six, giant statues that bounce around.
01:19:08<Kita> They do it in a big circle, a small circle, a big circle, a line from top to bottom, then repeat.
01:19:19<Kita> They take 5 SPIN ATTACKS
01:19:26<Kita> Or three arrows to kill.
01:19:30<Kita> Each one.
01:19:43<Kita> Eighteen arrows (You can carry thirty)
01:19:48<Kita> Ten Sword swings
01:19:57<Kita> or Five fucking Spin Attacks.
01:20:27<Kita> Spin Attacks are done by hold the swing sword button until your sword glints, then releasing.
01:20:49<Kita> If you're holding the swing sword button, you can do poke attacks until your sword glints.
01:21:05<Kita> Once it glints, your poke attack will DISMISS YOUR SPIN CHARGE.
01:21:17<Kita> Meaning... You'll do a poke, then put the sword away.
01:21:18<Kita> x.x
01:23:51<Laevos> x_x
01:24:38<Kita> So... the combat mechanics work against you.
01:25:04<Kita> Could be worse, though.
01:25:25<Kita> If you die, you could respawn with your current arrow count, at the start of the dungeon...
01:25:27<Kita> OH FUCKING WAIT
01:25:35<Kita> THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DIE
01:25:36<Kita> :D
01:25:43<Kita> A LINK TO THE PAST
01:25:56<Kita> DESIGNED TO BE FUCKING HARD AS BALLS IF YOU DON'T CONSERVE AMMO
01:26:07<Kita> GOOD THING THE BOW HAS GREAT TARGETING MECHANICS
01:26:11<Kita> OH WAIT
01:26:12<Kita> NOPE
01:26:15<Kita> OH WELL
01:27:12<Kita> Oh wait
01:27:14<Kita> A WELL
01:27:15<Kita> OF COURSE
01:27:21<Kita> THE WISHING WELL IN LAKE HYLIA!
01:28:14<Kita> That you can't get to without the Zora Flippers, which can only be accessed by having the Power Glove, which is the item in the second dungeon, which can only be reached after BEATING THE FUCKING ARMOS KNIGHTS.
01:28:15<Kita> ;.;
01:29:26<Laevos> ;-;
01:30:10<Kita> The Wishing Well allows you to increase your carrying capacity for bombs and arrows.
01:30:15<Kita> Funny thing
01:30:20<Kita> Having lots of bombs is great.
01:30:27<Kita> ARROWS ARE WAY MORE FUCKING IMPORTANT.
01:32:38<Kita> Lanmola went better.
01:32:42<Kita> Ice Rod.
01:32:44<Kita> Six shots.
01:33:10<Kita> How many shots does it take to kill Lanmola, with the Ice Rod? Six.
01:33:15<Kita> How many shots do you get? Six.
01:33:28<Kita> How many did Kita hit with? SIX MOTHERFUCKER.
01:33:41 Kita: summoned Lucifer by killing Lanmola.
01:34:27<Kita> (The number could also potentially be 616, but 666 is the more common.)

02:59:46<Laevos> yeah
02:59:48<Laevos> so sleepy
03:01:33 Kita: has designed the hardest game ever
03:01:39<Kita> You take the Moldorm fight
03:01:44<Kita> The Gyorg fight
03:01:51<Kita> And the first Ganon fight
03:02:15<Kita> From A Link to the Past, Majora's Mask, and Zelda 1, respectively... And repeat that for 100 rooms.
03:02:34<Laevos> :3
03:02:42<Kita> No.
03:02:46<Kita> Not ":3"
03:02:49<Laevos> ...3:
03:07:11<Kita> Moldorm is a worm, that randomly travels around on a small arena with a hole in it. It moves pretty fast, can only be hit on the tail.
03:07:20<Kita> Every it makes it move faster.
03:07:53<Kita> Every time you hit it in a place that isn't the tail, you are bounced backwards. Every time he hits you, you are bounced in the direction you were hit.
03:08:00<Kita> There is no edge.
03:08:10<Kita> There is also that hole.
03:08:22<Kita> You can fall. If you fall, you have to start the battle over again.
03:08:40<Kita> You are only given twelve spare hearts for the ENTIRE DUNGEON
03:08:49<Kita> Unless you get lucky with monster drops.
03:09:08<Kita> Moldorm travels randomly.
03:09:18<Kita> Scoots about wherever it wants.
03:09:28<Kita> Gyorg is fish. That lives in the water.
03:10:12<Kita> Link can swim on the surface, Deku Link can hop across water, but only so many times before dead, Goron Link has to avoid water like the plague, Zora Link has full swim capability.
03:10:36<Kita> Zora Link is the only option. There are no other ways to fight Gyorg. Have to Zora.
03:10:52<Kita> Zora Link has two attacks. Boomerang fins, and electric shield.
03:11:06<Kita> Boomerang fins are almost IMPOSSIBLE to aim, even with Z-targeting.
03:11:21<Kita> Electric shield is worthless, because it doesn't counter Gyorg's attacks.
03:11:38<Kita> So you have to use the Boomerangs.
03:12:13<Kita> Gyorg is fast as fuck. Attacks CONSTANTLY. Is fucking strong, and takes way too many hits to kill.
03:12:20<Kita> And Zora Link is worst link.
03:12:36<Kita> then Zelda 1 Ganon...
03:12:52<Kita> He teleports around the room, invisible, shooting energy balls that move fast.

12:38:50<Laevos> That's far away Q_Q
12:39:08<Kita> He just said he was going out of town.

12:39:18<Laevos> Hmm, Idaho...
12:39:23<Laevos> \(o.o)/
12:39:29<Kita> If he was within an hour, it wouldn't be the first time he has helped one of Kita's internet friends.
12:39:29<Kita> :P
12:39:36<Kita> He could lift that organ.

01:11:28<Kita> So
01:11:37<Kita> Kita is just getting around to watching Breaking Bad.
01:11:48<Kita> A handjob and anal in the first episode.
01:11:55<Laevos> lol
01:12:05<Laevos> Sounds like it's... off to... a great... start?
01:12:09<Kita> XD
01:13:56<Kita> It actually is really good.
01:14:17<Kita> The hetero sex is eh... But it isn't like in The Walking Dead where they make it a passionate thing.
01:14:56<Kita> In Breaking Bad it is a raw thing.
01:14:57<Kita> That was straight up, no lube, anal sex.
01:14:57<Kita> With a pregnant woman, no less.
01:15:02<Laevos> @_@
01:15:06<Kita> Yeah
01:15:10<Kita> Very raw.
01:15:15<Kita> XP
01:15:18<Laevos> lube is important

14:24:25<Kita> 74.38.52.173
14:25:42<Laevos> Hmm
14:27:01 Laevos: grumbles T_T
14:28:39<Kita> ?
14:29:22<Laevos> Trying to figure it out
14:29:31<Kita> <3
14:29:32<Laevos> it's giving me an error "No DHT nodes available for peer search."
14:29:42<Kita> ;.;
14:29:51<Laevos> and for some reason I can't connect to peers on the University network, so I can't seed from here on  my laptop ;-;
14:29:59<Laevos> apparently I need to download a torrent that can connect me to a hash table
14:30:01<Kita> ;.;
14:32:12<Laevos> need an actual torrent file though
14:32:14<Laevos> not a magnet link ;-;
14:32:27<Kita> T^T
14:36:41<Laevos> let me know if it shows up
14:36:44<Laevos> it looks like it might be working
14:36:54<Laevos> or at least trying to work ;-;
14:36:59<Kita> ;.;
14:40:48<Laevos> going to try a different program
14:40:51<Laevos> rtorrent seems too fidgety
14:41:17 Kita: uses uTorrent
14:41:46<Laevos> I do too, on my laptop
14:41:55<Laevos> but my server needs something that can be run from the command line
14:42:06<Kita> ;.;
14:42:08<Laevos> since it has no GUI
14:42:13<Laevos> going to try Deluge
14:43:02<Kita> goooey

15:00:24<Kita> Her stage costume has prosthetic breasts that spew fake blood.
15:00:25<Kita> o.o;
15:01:09<Laevos> o-o
15:02:07<Laevos> also
15:02:12<Laevos> Deluge is currently checking the torrent
15:02:15<Kita> :3
15:02:17<Laevos> so hopefully it'll start seeding soon
15:02:19<Laevos> if not
15:02:24<Laevos> I will actually poop out a brick
15:02:30<Laevos> a brick of disappointment T_T
15:02:32<Kita> ;.;
15:02:36<Kita> Don't do that
15:02:47<Kita> Bricks are abrasive and bad for your digestive track.
15:03:12<Laevos> Okay
15:03:15<Laevos> I won't do that
15:03:18<Laevos> but I will be disappointed
15:03:22 Kita: nods.
15:03:32<Laevos> sadly the console version of this program has very poor documentation :c
15:04:11<Laevos> had to mess with the file names
15:04:24<Kita> http://www.soylent.me/
15:04:29<Kita> This is an actual thing
15:04:35<Laevos> I.think.I.finally.realize.why.torrent.names.are.so.often.put.like.this.torrent
15:04:51<Laevos> I heard about that!
15:04:52<Kita> o.o
15:04:54<Laevos> Quite a while ago
15:04:57<Laevos> the soylent thing
15:04:57<Laevos> :3
15:05:05<Kita> It isn't made of people!
15:05:06<Kita> :D
15:05:35<Laevos> Hehehehehe xD
15:05:36<Laevos> It's not!
15:05:57<Kita> It also isn't vegan/vegetarian
15:06:35 Laevos: nods
15:06:50<Kita> From what Kita has found.
15:07:03<Kita> It includes fatty acids derived from animals.
15:07:52<Laevos> yeah
15:07:53<Laevos> fish oil
15:07:57<Laevos> it appears
15:08:10<Kita> Kita can't do it.
15:08:15 Laevos: nods :c
15:08:21<Kita> But it is interesting.
15:08:25<Laevos> It is!
15:08:45<Kita> And Kita thought Lilith would find it intriguing.
15:11:51<Laevos> I do, still! :3
15:11:58<Laevos> glad to see how it's progressed! :D
15:12:08<Kita> Yeah.
15:12:23<Kita> They now seperate the fatty acids in an oil additive.
15:12:46<Kita> But it doesn't seem to fit Kosher, Ital, and Hindi dietary standards.
15:12:52<Kita> Which Kita thinks is just fine.
15:13:16<Kita> Those fucking diets are bullshit pleas to outdated mythical figures that they force on children.

15:29:25<Kita> Kita is downloading.

15:29:58<Kita> Whatever you did

15:31:16<Kita> And then it really slowed down.

15:31:25<Laevos> it does that
15:31:26<Laevos> torrents ;-;

15:36:58<Laevos> Eep!
15:37:02<Laevos> Goddess has so many cookies though
15:37:03<Laevos> SO MANY
15:37:11<Kita> X3
15:37:27<Laevos> That's more cookies than any mortal dare face alone...
15:37:35<Laevos> actually probably more than the entire human population could take down
15:37:44<Kita> o.o
15:37:50<Laevos> from cookie clicker
15:37:51<Kita> Well, yes.
15:37:53<Laevos> :3
15:37:56<Laevos> I mean all at once
15:38:01<Kita> Duodecillion?
15:38:01<Laevos> I'm sure they'd get through them eventually
15:38:05<Laevos> omg
15:38:10<Kita> X3
15:38:14<Laevos> maybe they wouldn't
15:38:24<Laevos> maybe the freaking heat death of the universe would cut them off before they could finish
15:38:26<Laevos> I don't know
15:38:28<Laevos> >u>
15:38:32<Kita> That is getting close to "amount of particles in the universe" levels.
15:39:08<Laevos> Yeah xD
15:39:47<Laevos> I think the sheer density of cookies would have formed a supermassive black hole by this point

16:53:21<Kita> Well
16:53:25<Kita> Kita doesn't have it yet
16:53:29<Kita> And Bro was like
16:53:50<Kita> "I was waiting for you to upgrade to legit, grade 5 ganja, little sister"
16:54:05<Kita> In his half-German, half-Oregonian accent
16:54:17<Laevos> xDDDDD
16:54:21<Laevos> That's so kawaii
16:55:53<Kita> Kita responds with
16:56:15<Kita> "Motherfucker, you think Kita's playing? Give her the high school shit. Grade 5 is fucking elementary."
16:56:52<Kita> "Look, creampuff. I got shit with a college degree hanging in the basement. Want a hit?"
16:57:18<Kita> And he gave Kita an ounce and Kita kissed his cheek and offered to cook him dinner.
16:58:01<Laevos> D'awwwwww
17:00:58<Kita> Bro is fucking Brahsome
17:01:17<Laevos> He sounds great xD
17:01:39<Laevos> And does he really call you crampuff?
17:01:41<Laevos> *creampuff
17:01:47<Kita> Sometimes.
17:01:57<Kita> It started when Kita was chubbing up.
17:02:26<Laevos> That's so cute though ;-;
17:05:08 Kita: nods.
17:05:37<Kita> He encourages it... Said "Yeah, you look better bigger."
17:06:04<Kita> But that was two hundred pounds ago.
17:08:19<Kita> But her provides for Kita
17:09:50<Laevos> He seems amazing ;-
17:10:03<Kita> He is
17:10:06<Laevos> :3
17:10:38<Kita> He is a ridiculous manwhore, though.
17:11:12<Laevos> Oh~? >u>
17:11:20<Kita> Yeah.
17:12:06<Laevos> >uuuuuuuuu>
17:12:26<Kita> He is currently seeing six girls.
17:12:32<Laevos> Oh my xD
17:12:35<Kita> Two of which were at his place, this morning.
17:12:44<Kita> And of them flirted with Kita.
17:12:59<Kita> But she was a little old for Kita.
17:12:59<Laevos> At the same time? o_o
17:13:06<Kita> Yes!
17:13:25<Laevos> Oh my, that is interesting xD
17:13:39 Kita: nods.
17:13:44<Kita> He is a swinger.
17:14:34<Laevos> Ohhhhh okay :3
17:14:38<Kita> The older girl was like... 30.
17:15:03<Kita> Kivaya says she wishes she could be his sugar mama, but he is loaded and doesn't need one.
17:15:04<Kita> XP
17:15:19<Laevos> How old is he? o_o
17:15:28<Kita> 27.
17:15:57<Laevos> Oh okay
17:16:15<Laevos> I have it in my head that Kita is roughly the same age as Lilith but I'm not sure >_>
17:16:22<Kita> Kita is 22.
17:16:23<Kita> o.o
17:16:25<Laevos> okay
17:16:27<Laevos> so is Lilith :3
17:16:29<Laevos> I WAS RIGHT
17:16:38<Kita> Kita graduated High School at like... 15, though.
17:17:12<Laevos> :3
17:17:31<Kita> Crazy psycho Kita was a supergenius.
17:17:43<Kita> Medicated Kita is just a genius.
17:18:38<Laevos> well
17:18:45<Laevos> probably better this way, yes?
17:18:49<Laevos> don't know if supergeniushood is worth it :c
17:18:56<Kita> Almost.
17:19:07<Kita> Until Kita started using it to plan murders.
17:19:40 Laevos: nods >_>
17:19:49<Kita> so yeah.
17:23:14<Kita> Until Kita actually took down a man and incapacitated him... her own brother... using just her ability to know things and figure things out...
17:23:26<Kita> With no training. No pre-meditation.
17:25:26<Laevos> @_@
17:26:39<Kita> But
17:27:06<Kita> Kita is better now.

17:46:37<Laevos> Yes, Goddess? <3
17:47:01<Kita> What would Lilith cook for Kita.
17:48:11<Laevos> Hmm...
17:48:18 Laevos: looks around her house...
17:48:20 Laevos: frets @_@
17:48:32<Kita> From Kita's kitchen.
17:48:37<Kita> Not Lilith's, sweetie.
17:48:39<Kita> X3
17:48:42<Laevos> Good ;n;
17:48:49<Laevos> hmm... what kinds of things does Kita have? o_o
17:49:02<Kita> Everything
17:49:27 Laevos: nods Q_Q
17:50:24<Kita> So Lilith could make practically anything.
17:50:53<Laevos> Lilith needs more cooking experience with new things
17:51:01<Laevos> have mainly been limited to things like stir-fries...
17:51:12<Laevos> which I could do
17:51:23<Kita> Simple doesn't mean bad!
17:51:29<Laevos> with rice and lots of veggies and whatever kinds of meat that Kita would want!
17:51:42<Laevos> Lilith uses either tofu or chicken most of the time or SOMETIMES SQUID
17:51:47<Laevos> squid stir-fry is good :3
17:52:11<Kita> But squid is not a thing Kita can eat
17:52:29<Kita> Kita likes pork.
17:52:35<Kita> Pork is good meat
17:52:36<Kita> <3
17:53:34<Kita> Oh
17:53:47<Kita> Kivaya sometimes calls Kita "puff pastry" too.
17:58:03<Laevos> oh right
17:58:08<Laevos> forgot about the seafood thing, forgive me Q_Q
17:58:11<Laevos> but pork is fine as well :3

23:26:49<Kita> Don't let it make you feel bad.
23:27:09<Laevos> thank you...
23:27:17<Laevos> I just feel bad in general
23:27:22<Laevos> made bad decisions today
23:27:43<Kita> ?
23:28:31<Laevos> got on Craigslist v_v sorry, Goddess
23:28:44<Kita> :<
23:29:32<Laevos> it didn't go badly, at least... he was cute and had Pikachu socks on...
23:29:48<Kita> Was he actually cute?
23:30:01<Laevos> Goddess wouldn't think so
23:30:11 Kita: shakes her head.
23:30:22<Kita> Of course not, but Kita wasn't the judge here.
23:30:38<Kita> Did Lilith find him cute, for real?
23:30:42<Laevos> yeah
23:30:59<Kita> Well then... That should be a win, right?
23:31:06<Kita> Did you get a name, a number?
23:31:18<Laevos> got his number to give him directions
23:31:26<Laevos> but he left right after, was on his way to the gym I guess?
23:31:31<Laevos> wanted minimal interaction
23:31:35<Laevos> it seemed like
23:31:37<Kita> Awwwr...
23:31:46<Kita> Sweetie...
23:31:57<Kita> Those aren't the Johns to go for.
23:32:00<Laevos> it's okay
23:32:14<Laevos> he just wanted to give somebody oral, and he did, and he did, and he was good at it
23:32:14<Kita> They aren't.
23:32:30<Laevos> he even asked if he should take his shoes off at the door, which was nice
23:32:35<Laevos> I appreciated that ^~^
23:32:38<Kita> Polite is good.
23:35:22 Laevos: nods
23:35:28<Laevos> it happened very quickly

16:29:17<Kita> ;.;
16:29:49<Kita> Pikachu gets all the love.
16:30:14<Kita> The only Raichu that ever featured a prominent role in the animu was Lt. Surge's evil one.
16:31:11<Laevos> Aww ;-;
16:31:14<Laevos> and it was just made fun of
16:31:17<Laevos> for being TOO SLOW
16:31:37<Kita> Except Raichu is faster than Pikachu.
16:31:42<Laevos> yeah
16:31:43<Kita> By enough to be noticeable.
16:31:45<Laevos> that was dumb ^~^
16:31:54<Kita> Pikachu gets Light Ball.
16:31:59<Kita> Raichu doesn't get shit.
16:32:19<Kita> Volt Tackle, Choice Band Raichu
16:33:02<Laevos> omg
16:33:03<Laevos> too many volts
16:33:17<Kita> not enough tackle

20:47:30<Laevos> *Hello
20:51:03<Laevos> Nice replays ~u~
20:51:19<Kita> Cluuuuutch
20:53:03<Laevos> The best ~u~
20:53:35 Kita: puts a peppermint stick in lilith's mouth
20:55:47<Kita> Kita is trying to download TeamSpeak so she can listen to her friends as they play games
20:55:55<Kita> But the file won't fucking complete.
20:56:02<Kita> And FireFox keeps saying it is
20:56:11 Laevos: nomps it :3
20:56:13<Laevos> Awwh ;-;
20:56:16<Laevos> that's not good :c
20:56:41<Kita> So Kita keeps having to retry, replacing the corrupted download files.
20:57:20<Laevos> Ughhhhh xnx
20:57:27<Kita> Also
20:58:14<Kita> Kita's router has spawned a second connection that does nothing, has no data flowing in or out of it, and forces all computers with wireless cards to connect to it.
20:58:15<Kita> Literally ghost connection.
20:58:46<Laevos> ...what o_o
20:58:56<Kita> Yes.
20:59:21<Kita> Nothing happens on it.
20:59:31<Kita> Kita can't seem to trace it baack to anything, except the router.
20:59:44<Kita> And the router doesn't to be forcing anything new.
21:00:17<Laevos> Weird... o_o
21:00:53<Kita> Ugh
21:01:00<Kita> Can you download this: http://dl.4players.de/ts/releases/3.0.16/TeamSpeak3-Client-win32-3.0.16.exe
21:01:04<Kita> And .ZIP it.
21:01:09<Kita> Then e-mail it to Kita?
21:01:31 Laevos: nods <3
21:01:42<Kita> Gotta get it under 25 megabytes
21:01:50<Kita> Otherwise, it won't send. :<
21:02:14 Laevos: nods <3
21:02:28<Kita> Thankies
21:02:38<Laevos> Of course, Goddess! :3
21:06:14<Kita> Is it doing stuff
21:06:44<Laevos> Yeah, it downloaded
21:06:51<Kita> Okay
21:06:52<Kita> ;.;
21:07:03<Kita> Kita just needs the .exe
21:07:33 Laevos: nods
21:07:38<Laevos> what e-mail?
21:07:47<Kita> kitakazamaki@gmail.com
21:07:49<Kita> o.o;
21:10:08 Laevos: sends
21:11:03 Kita: waits.
21:11:15<Kita> E-Mail is not as instantaneous as it should be
21:12:07<Laevos> They're still in outbox :c
21:12:19<Laevos> Sending is slow :cccc
21:12:23<Kita> ?
21:12:28<Kita> awwwr
21:13:00<Laevos> Oh crap, sent from the wrong e-mail address
21:13:03<Laevos> that's why it's not going T_T
21:13:24<Kita> o.o
21:13:57<Laevos> oh wait
21:13:59<Laevos> maybe it did work!
21:14:21<Laevos> In the past I haven't been able to send e-mail as my student e-mail address from Windows Live
21:14:24<Laevos> but I think it worked this time :3
21:15:01<Kita> So how does Kita put the pieces back together
21:15:03<Kita> :<
21:15:17<Laevos> Just unzip the first one with 7zip
21:15:22<Laevos> making sure they're in the same directory
21:16:57<Kita> Will Kita want to unzip both?
21:17:37<Laevos> No
21:17:39<Laevos> just the first one
21:17:46<Kita> Okay
21:17:47<Laevos> as long as they're in the same directory, it'll find all the information it needs
21:17:56 Kita: nods
21:22:44<Laevos> Did it worked? Q_Q
21:22:55<Kita> Not really?
21:23:03<Laevos> x_x
21:23:05<Laevos> what happened? Dx
21:23:08<Kita> Kind of
21:23:17<Kita> It keeps failing
21:23:24<Laevos> :/ To extract?
21:24:05<Kita> But at least FireFox is going "oh, it failed. retry?"
21:24:06<Kita> Instead of "6.8 out of 20 MBs. It's done. :3"
21:24:12<Kita> No
21:24:16<Kita> To download
21:24:44<Laevos> From e-mail?
21:24:49<Kita> Yes
21:24:50<Laevos> Should I send them through Skype?
21:24:53<Kita> No.
21:25:06<Kita> Kita has Skype off because it was chokeslamming her computer.
21:25:12 Laevos: nods T_T
21:25:20<Laevos> And dcc didn't seem to work on your computer
21:25:27<Laevos> uhh
21:25:29<Laevos> does Kita have dropbox?
21:25:34<Kita> No.
21:25:38<Laevos> neither do I :c
21:25:41<Kita> Kita has torrents
21:25:42<Kita> ;.;
21:25:48<Laevos> Okay <3
21:25:50<Laevos> Lilith can torrent it
21:25:51<Kita> But this is kind of working
21:25:54<Kita> So
21:25:58<Kita> This will do okay
21:26:06<Laevos> KKind of working?
21:26:12<Kita> Yeah
21:26:18<Kita> Like Kita said
21:26:21<Kita> it keeps failing
21:26:27<Laevos> but downloading more every time?
21:26:32<Kita> Yeah.
21:26:48<Kita> Retries start back on where they left off.
21:26:49<Laevos> well alright Q_Q
21:26:51 Laevos: nods
21:27:03<Kita> But only if it says it failed
21:27:22<Kita> If it goes "It's done. :3 6.8 = 20.0. Yup. Done."
21:27:30<Kita> then you have to restart
21:27:31<Kita> x.x
21:27:45<Laevos> T_T
21:27:55 Laevos: kicks firefox's stupid face Dx
21:28:11 Laevos: also kisses Kitagoddessfox's beautiful and amazing face :cccc
21:28:47 Kita: petpats
21:28:56<Kita> Thank you, sweetie.
21:29:03<Kita> Would like something to nom on
21:29:53 Laevos: just bought some Hello Panda snack things? ;w;
21:29:54<Kita> Because Kita has foxtails!
21:29:58<Laevos> :33333
21:30:36 Kita: holds up a caramel tube filled with cream cheese frosting, marbled with sea salt and dark chocolate.
21:30:55 Laevos: licks at it o_o
21:30:59<Laevos> It looks so decadent :3
21:31:17<Kita> It iiiiiiiis
21:31:26<Kita> And Kita has 6 of them
21:31:49<Kita> A nearby pastry shop made them for Kita.
21:31:49<Laevos> Eeeee! o/////o
21:31:52<Laevos> Nice! ;u;
21:32:16<Kita> Kita gets something from there every day...
21:32:41<Kita> Either herself or her brother gets it.
21:32:41<Kita> But it is always for Kita.
21:32:42<Kita> And because Kita is there a lot, they made a treat for Kita to try.
21:32:58<Kita> And if Kita likes them, they'll sell them regularly.
21:33:08<Kita> because everything Kita likes sells in droves.
21:33:22<Laevos> D'awwwww ^^
21:33:25<Laevos> Kita is just amazing :3
21:35:03<Kita> It worked!

01:15:04<Kita> ...?
01:15:22<Kita> How does one not know their own blood type
01:15:40<Kita> It goes on your driver's liscense.
01:18:30<Laevos> It's not on mine :3
01:18:39<Kita> :<
01:18:53<Kita> You have to know it for blood transfusions
01:19:04<Laevos> Never successfully had my blood drawn
01:19:20<Kita> Why not?
01:19:37<Laevos> severe needle phobia prevented it from being possible
01:22:16<Laevos> couldn't even get tetnus-prevention shots without being given a muscle relaxant
01:22:29<Laevos> because I'd go into such intense fits that it was impossible to inject me with anything
01:22:39<Kita> o.o
01:23:01<Laevos> yup
01:23:21<Laevos> It's  not like it's legal for me to give blood anyway, so...
01:23:56<Kita> Why is it not legal?
01:24:11<Laevos> because I've had sex with other men
01:24:16<Laevos> and you're not allowed to give blood if you've ever done that
01:24:26<Kita> Then you should advocate.
01:24:36<Laevos> I wouldn't give blood even if it were legal...
01:24:37<Laevos> sorry
01:25:12<Kita> You should advocate, regardless
01:25:27<Laevos> I'll leave that to people who have the time and energy to do so...
01:25:47<Laevos> I don't really have the fight in me to put myself into a cause that I'd be investing so little into...

01:36:31 Laevos: holds gently and leans on
01:36:35<Laevos> I love you, Goddess...
01:36:39<Laevos> it's been such a stressful night
01:36:44<Kita> What happened?
01:37:06<Laevos> and things are just getting to be too much... the laptop keeps overheating and cutting me off from you and everybody else that I can talk to right now and I'm just really emotional tonight...
01:37:28<Laevos> it just feels like I'm locked into this stupid, broken machine that actively tries to attack me whenever I'm vulnerable x_x
01:37:32<Laevos> I know that's stupid...
01:37:35 Laevos: curls up on
01:37:52<Kita> You should take it to a computer repair sho
01:37:53<Kita> p
01:38:06<Kita> A lot of them do free diagnostics
01:38:43<Kita> Or maybe you should take it apart, clean it, and get a fan deck for it
01:38:48<Laevos> It's just old, I suspect... kept around longer than it has any right to live ;-;
01:38:52<Laevos> maybe
01:38:58<Laevos> that might help, or maybe it needs new thermal paste on the CPU
01:39:17<Laevos> but at that point I might as well repair my original laptop which is a much better computer besides the fact that the screen is broken...
01:39:30<Laevos> this one was pretty much purchased as a last-minute emergency before I went overseas
01:40:48<Kita> Oh
01:40:58<Kita> Repair the screen on the other one
01:40:59<Kita> <3
01:41:14 Laevos: nods
01:41:25<Laevos> think it needs a new connector between the monitor and the motherboard
01:41:29<Laevos> because
01:41:34<Laevos> when it first started breaking
01:41:43<Laevos> it wasn't like parts of the screen went black
01:41:47<Laevos> it was either all on or all off
01:41:57<Laevos> and I could tilt it a certain way and make it come back on
01:41:59<Kita> Wait
01:42:03<Kita> Wait!
01:42:15<Kita> Is it an ASUS?
01:42:19<Laevos> nope :c
01:42:22<Kita> Awwwr
01:42:25<Laevos> It's a Dell
01:42:32<Laevos> I know /why/ it happened
01:42:40<Laevos> it fell off the bed one too many times when I was sleeping T_T
01:43:07<Kita> In 2010-2012 ASUS models, the power switch creates EM field that triggers the "laptop closed" state.
01:43:12<Kita> Crazy, right?
01:43:16<Laevos> yes @_@
01:43:31<Kita> But only if it gets a short in a particularly vulnerable spot.
01:43:54<Laevos> Ughhhh :c
01:44:19<Kita> In 2013, they fixed it.
01:44:26<Kita> And started producing replacements
01:44:54<Laevos> that's good, at least
01:45:14<Kita> Maybe it is a similar problem/
01:45:43<Laevos> I'm pretty sure it was caused by physical damage :c
01:46:03<Kita> :<
01:46:07<Laevos> because it happened in stages
01:46:32<Laevos> and first went from being fine to being all fuzzy and warped and such
01:46:40<Laevos> to going completely black when it wasn't in the right spot
01:46:41<Kita> :<
01:46:43<Laevos> to being completely black always
01:47:02<Laevos> pretty sure the connection cable was damaged in some way, but I should bring it in somewhere regardless
01:47:18<Laevos> just need to find somewhere that isn't Best Buy... I'm kind of wary of them for repairs

20:40:51<Kita> Eeeeee~
20:41:00<Laevos> and the guy there seemed pretty cool
20:41:16<Laevos> lots of open source stuff, computer parts for really cheap, a wood/metalworking shop
20:42:46<Laevos> hmm... also...
20:42:48<Laevos> Lilith could...
20:42:57<Laevos> put the rest of the DVDs into one pretty huge torrent
20:43:11<Laevos> (huge here meaning like... 24GB)
20:43:25<Laevos> just so it can all be worked on without pause
20:43:28<Kita> That could work
20:43:37<Laevos> especially since the server can always be seeding now

22:47:04<Kita> o.o?
22:48:25<Laevos> Pretty sure she's some kind of silly Christian or something; in class we were going over neurology, and the neocortex being the more recently-developed part of the brain from an evolutionary standpoint, and one of the students was confused by that; the instructor kind of just glossed it over like "Oh well the book says some weird thing about evolution but that's just their theory you know and
22:48:25<Laevos> theories are wrong all the time" blah blah blah xnx
22:51:32<Kita> >>
22:52:19<Laevos> ~Kansas~
22:52:23<Kita> You should tell her that if the most empirically true idea in all of modern science is wrong, that she should write her thesis, get it peer-reviewed, and become empiress of science
22:55:21<Laevos> xD
22:59:01<Kita> OR
22:59:18<Kita> Believing in creationism is the adult equivalent of believing in the Stork
22:59:27<Kita> Like, not the animal
22:59:36<Kita> But the "babies come from delivery storks"
23:00:56<Laevos> Yeah, I know
23:01:10<Laevos> Not as bad as the fundie chemistry teacher I had in high school... yet >_>

23:01:25<Laevos> I don't know
23:01:38<Laevos> well
23:01:43<Laevos> not a chemist
23:01:46<Laevos> a high-school chemistry teacher
23:01:51<Laevos> but still x_x
23:02:35<Kita> Walter White is both a chemist AND a High School Chemistry Teacher

23:06:07<Kita> Those
23:06:09<Kita> Mental
23:06:11<Kita> Backflips
23:06:30<Laevos> It's easy not to think about the inherent contradictions there when you don't think much at all >w>
23:06:43<Kita> Well like
23:06:53<Kita> Time dilation itself disproves God
23:07:10<Kita> Because it disproves time happening before the universe existed
23:08:00<Laevos> I guess they just assume that whatever god they worship is like a lousy DM
23:08:07<Laevos> able to change whichever rules whenever
23:08:14<Laevos> and just be like
23:08:16<Kita> But...

14:17:59<Kita> Management is a skill, not a title.
14:18:10<Laevos> :3
14:18:27<Kita> Like.. No one is a manager for a dev team
14:18:52<Laevos> Looks like a cool video
14:19:02<Kita> They just kind of shuffle along towards a goal.
14:19:13<Kita> It is just GabeN talking.
14:19:23<Kita> But he is not just a business genius
14:19:31<Kita> He is an ETHICAL business genius.
14:19:55<Kita> The world would be a better place if more companies took VALVe's work into consideration

14:22:41<Laevos> sometimes you just have to say "okay it's done now"
14:22:47<Kita> Yeah
14:23:45<Laevos> Lots of great things have been... if not ruined, given possible negative associations because the creator(s) didn't know when to say "enough is enough." :c
14:24:03<Kita> Yes.
14:24:09<Kita> That is very profound
14:24:18<Kita> Good statement, sweetie.
14:24:25<Laevos> Thank you, Goddess <3
14:24:44<Kita> HL3 will be made.
14:25:02<Laevos> I don't doubt it, to be honest
14:25:05<Kita> But it might have to take a long time to live up to the hype it will generate.
14:25:28<Kita> And it will have to come out immediately upon completion.
14:25:33<Kita> Or else the hype will die
14:26:23<Laevos> Yeah... that's very true.
14:26:59 Kita: nods.
14:27:03<Kita> And they probably know this.
14:27:11<Laevos> And sometimes it's just not possible to live up to everyone's expectations... like when you get part of a song stuck in your head and go back to listen to it, only to find out that the version in your head was better than the real thing
14:27:13<Kita> HL3 will probably be announced
14:27:20<Laevos> (that happens to me pretty frequently >_>)
14:27:24 Laevos: nods
14:27:28 Kita: nods.
14:27:41<Kita> And then it will probably come out next day
14:28:57<Laevos> That would be neat-o
14:29:07<Kita> X3

14:36:23<Kita> VALVe creating their marketplace created an actual economy to rival that of most first-world countries.
14:36:50<Laevos> I didn't know that o:
14:36:57<Kita> Yeah.
14:37:10<Laevos> Maybe some other countries should just switch all of their industries
14:37:13<Laevos> to video games sales >u>
14:37:21<Laevos> :P
14:37:32<Kita> Some people make more money through the VALVe marketplace than they do at jobs that require degrees in FWCs.
14:39:05<Laevos> yeah @_@

14:44:31<Laevos> Cool :3
14:44:39<Laevos> well they certainly seem to have been successful >u>
14:45:02<Kita> Considering that they are the 4th largest consumer of bandwidth in the world?
14:45:05<Kita> Yes
14:45:08<Kita> Yes, they are.
14:45:44<Laevos> QuQ
14:46:06<Kita> Especially since they try to keep as far out of the Business-Consumer relationship as possible
14:47:46<Laevos> What do you mean?
14:48:06<Kita> Steam is like a store.
14:48:15<Kita> It is a lot of other things, but it is like a store.
14:48:24<Kita> Instead of strictly controlling the content
14:48:51<Kita> They allow the businesses, through an API, and users, through the marketplace, to basically just sell whatever they want
14:49:24<Laevos> Oh, yeah

22:04:04<Laevos> I'm sorry ;n;

22:06:18<Kita> o.o
22:06:25<Laevos> Goddess! ;u;
22:06:35<Kita> Hi sweetie
22:06:51<Laevos> I went to the first meeting of the Makerspace place
22:06:53<Laevos> and maybe
22:06:56<Laevos> just maybe
22:06:58<Laevos> made some friends? :3
22:07:25<Kita> Oooo
22:09:01<Laevos> Had a long and really nice conversation with a woman (about our age?) who was doing photography (specifically, this: http://www.lawrenceinsideout.com/ ) She asked to take pictures of me, and was saying how good at posing I was, which was kind of amusing xD Afterwards I asked her about black and white photography and we had a discussion about photography and this community art center that I'm
22:09:01<Laevos> going to check out and how she's going through the same Master's program that I'm probably going to go to
22:09:29<Kita> :3
22:10:44<Laevos> She was really  nice! She might be able to get me a job at the library in the new sound studio they just set up, sooo :3
22:10:52<Laevos> that'll be good, especially for after I graduate
22:11:08 Kita: nods.
22:11:12<Kita> Connections are good.
22:11:27<Kita> Be a little social networker, you silly kitty
22:11:36 Laevos: licks :3
22:11:55 Kita: jingles her bell.
22:13:03 Laevos: purrrrrrrs~ o;

23:12:53<Kita> *w*
23:13:05<Laevos> Yesssssss :'3
23:14:59<Kita> Bullet Hells are so underappreciated
23:14:59<Kita> Even Kita did not appreciate them until she decided to play Bullet Heaven 1.
23:14:59<Kita> And then she played like...
23:14:59<Kita> 15.
23:14:59<Kita> And it was <3
23:15:13<Laevos> I played a few Touhous

23:17:45<Laevos> Never played ;-;
23:18:53<Kita> Kita has it on Steam
23:19:07<Kita> The gimmick is that you are fighting two kinds of ships
23:19:11<Kita> White and Black
23:19:21<Kita> And you can flip your ship to be white or black
23:19:42<Kita> White-you absorbs white bullets, Black-you absorbs black bullets.
23:20:11<Kita> White you shoots white bullets, and they do more damage to black ships.
23:20:11<Kita> Black you shoots black bullets, and they do more damage to white ships.
23:20:24<Kita> And that is the gimmick
23:21:03<Laevos> Oh okay :3
23:21:29<Kita> Pewpewpewpew
23:21:42<Laevos> pewpewpewpewpew
23:21:57<Kita> Also, FFXIII is coming to Steam
23:22:00<Kita> So... yay...?
23:22:15<Kita> There were parts of XIII that Kita liked, and parts she didn't.
23:22:19<Kita> And it felt like a PC game
23:22:21<Kita> So
23:22:24<Kita> Yeah.

16:25:14<Kita> Not from you?
16:25:53<Laevos> 24.124.49.217:58846
16:25:58<Laevos> okay, that's fine
16:26:21<Laevos> that's why I suggested spreading it to as many people as possible
16:26:27<Laevos> since it seems like our connection to one another isn't the #1 best
16:28:05<Kita> Are you IPv6?
16:29:58<Laevos> Nope o_o
16:30:07<Kita> Oky
16:30:58<Laevos> well as long as it's going
16:31:13<Laevos> I dunno who the IPv6 would be though
16:31:19<Laevos> the only peer I have is IPv4
16:31:28<Kita> Nono
16:31:32<Kita> Kita was just asking
16:31:38<Laevos> Oh okay

05:10:22<Laevos> my friend and I went to walmart
05:10:33<Laevos> I got a laser printer for $30 that was marked down in clearance from $140
05:10:49<Laevos> came back to my house and I learned how to do some stuff in After Effects
05:11:05<Laevos> which my brother (not brah) uploaded to YouTube
05:11:18<Laevos> (he put the music in) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGOu57us1RQ
05:11:35<Laevos> brah, on the other hand, apparently had much cooler plans for tonight

06:05:50<Laevos> 4^4 combinations
06:05:58<Kita> Nono... The missing combos.
06:06:19<Laevos> Hmm?
06:06:27<Kita> [04:05:24] <AlbinoFox> Heh
06:06:27<Kita> [04:06:07] <AlbinoFox> FFVII has eight combos in a side thing that are missing as combinatons
06:06:28<Kita> [04:06:22] <AlbinoFox> Seems you can't even enter them as valid combos.
06:06:28<Kita> [04:06:22] <Laevos> yes
06:06:28<Kita> [04:06:22] <Laevos> (also)
06:06:31<Laevos> oh
06:06:36<Laevos> didn't get those last two messages Dx
06:06:44<Laevos> just up to "heh"

06:07:01<Kita> So then, what was the yes (also) for
06:07:02<Laevos> I had no idea about the FFVII thing, as I've never played it
06:07:02<Kita> :<
06:07:10<Laevos> [06:04:11] <AlbinoFox> So, if a code has four possible entries per slot, and four slots... then there should be 256 combinations.
06:08:11<Kita> yes twice?
06:08:36<Laevos> first yes was
06:08:43<Laevos> because
06:08:52<Laevos> I thought you were saying "Hm" at the orange dragon thing
06:08:56<Kita> Oh
06:09:01<Laevos> so this was another yes

15:11:57<Laevos> How are you, Goddess? 
15:12:16<Kita> Hiccups
15:14:26 Laevos: wiggles
15:14:46<Laevos> I made a silly video
15:14:49<Laevos> wanna see?
15:15:01 Kita: nods
15:15:22<Laevos> Okay
15:15:31<Laevos> there's a somewhat loud bass sound
15:15:36<Laevos> so maybe turn volume down a bit
15:15:40<Laevos> https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=10205012816427980&permPage=1
15:15:48<Laevos> (I made it public, you don't need to Facebook to see it)
15:16:04<Laevos> (HD makes it slightly less blocky, but Facebook compression still exists :ccc)
15:17:05 Kita: doesn't get it.
15:17:06<Kita> o.o
15:19:19<Laevos> well
15:19:20<Laevos> that's good
15:19:23<Laevos> because...
15:19:25 Laevos: leans in close
15:19:28 Laevos: whispers
15:19:31<Laevos> there's nothing to get >u>
15:19:45<Laevos> I was messing around in After Effects and was like I LIKE COLOR AND SHAEP
15:19:57<Kita> oo.o
15:20:02<Laevos> the sound was the result of
15:20:08<Laevos> exporting the original video file
15:20:12<Laevos> opening it in Audacity as raw data
15:20:17<Laevos> and exporting that as a 16 bit WAV
15:21:02<Kita> o.o
15:21:48<Laevos> :3
15:22:15<Laevos> That was the second most productive thing I did this weekend.

17:31:21<Laevos> some guy came up to me as I was walking  to my car and started talking to me about nanobots
17:34:25<Kita> Yeah?
17:34:33<Kita> Was he selling them?
17:37:11<Laevos> No
17:37:22<Laevos> he wants to work on developing them
17:37:32<Laevos> ones that work with the human genome to repair damage and extend life as long as youw ant
17:37:35<Laevos> *want
17:37:42<Laevos> so we discussed the practical implementations of that
17:37:49<Kita> X3
17:37:55<Laevos> He's a freshman
17:38:00<Laevos> I think he was just surprised that I engaged him on it
17:38:05<Laevos> since he followed me all the way to my car
17:38:11<Laevos> which was clearly quite out of the way of wherever he was going
17:38:12<Kita> o.o
17:38:18<Laevos> like
17:38:23<Laevos> we were talking the whole time
17:38:30<Laevos> he wasn't silently following me
17:38:42<Kita> n.n
17:39:20<Laevos> Yep! :3
17:39:34<Laevos> If I ever see him again
17:39:40<Laevos> I should ask him how that's going
17:39:59<Laevos> and introduce him to Kita, Goddess of Robot

18:24:37<Kita> o.o
18:24:44<Laevos> a photographer posted a picture of my face
18:24:51<Laevos> for the "Lawrence Inside Out" thing she's doing
18:24:55<Laevos> and my partner saved the picture
18:24:59<Laevos> and on her iPhone...
18:25:01<Laevos> turned it into...
18:25:04<Laevos> something horrifying...
18:25:29<Laevos> https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/v/t34.0-12/10695272_963936340288267_656894718_n.jpg?oh=6e4336662a1b923074d296adc9db8e52&oe=542C8A39&__gda__=1412180516_4dde1b9a265e085c405921c23fc5887e

18:26:45 Laevos: is an eldritch horror
18:26:47 Kita: giggles at it
18:26:51<Laevos> xux
18:26:54<Laevos> She was cracking up
18:27:03<Kita> Kita is, too.
18:27:08<Laevos> :3333
18:27:12<Laevos> you can see the original if you want
18:27:28 Kita: shrugs
18:27:31<Laevos> but it includes a really silly quote that the photographer chose to ~represent~ me ;-;

18:29:20<Laevos> YEAH YEAH
18:29:22<Laevos> LAUGH IT UP
18:29:30<Laevos> she just said to talk about art things that I do
18:29:31<Kita> DOING SO
18:29:35<Laevos> I didn't realize it was going to end up as
18:29:38<Laevos> A GOD DAMN
18:29:40<Laevos> INSPIRATIONAL QUOTE
18:29:46<Kita> XD
18:30:01<Laevos> I think other people got asked different questions >:c
18:30:11<Laevos> like some of the quotes were how great of a community the city is
18:30:14 Kita: giggles.
18:30:16<Laevos> how it's great for collaboration and art stuff
18:30:21<Laevos> but no
18:30:27<Laevos> I PLRY INRSTRSRMNT
18:30:37<Kita> Lilith is so lulzy
18:31:02<Laevos> I'm glad that I can be a source of CONSTANT AMUSEMENT for you, Goddess
18:31:05<Laevos> as that is my lifelong goal
18:31:12<Laevos> oh no
18:31:13<Laevos> ;-;;
18:31:17<Laevos> I just realized
18:31:32<Laevos> there might be a huge version of that picture(and maybe the quote) put up downtown this Spring
18:31:40<Laevos> since she's making huge prints of pictures from this series
18:31:41<Laevos> and doing that with them
18:31:42<Laevos> NOOOOOOOOO
18:31:50<Kita> X3
18:32:17<Laevos> T_T
18:32:23<Laevos> I'll take a picture if that happens

13:56:21<Laevos> just found out that a fraternity that's been closed down for drugging/raping a bunch of women at a party is one of the ones right on the other side of the street...
13:56:26<Laevos> like... that my apartment complex faces...
13:56:51<Kita> D:
13:56:59<Laevos> Disgusting...
13:57:04<Laevos> I hope they get shut down...
13:57:19<Laevos> they were the ones that always seem to be in a drunken frenzy when I walk home from class...
13:57:56<Kita> Don't kill anyone.

13:14:52<Laevos> Meow!
13:14:58<Laevos> How are you? :'3
13:15:26<Kita> Addicted to sm4sh
13:15:40<Laevos> Yay! :3
13:15:45<Laevos> I can't afford it yet
13:15:48<Laevos> but someday!
13:16:31<Kita> X3
13:16:53<Laevos> by which point I'll have a lot of catching up to do :ccccc
13:18:08<Laevos> but I'm glad that Goddess is enjoying it :3
13:18:44<Kita> It plays so good
13:19:10<Laevos> Eeeee! ^u^
13:19:12<Kita> With the new meteor mechanics, you know when a hit is strong enough to KO
13:19:18<Laevos> Favorite character? ouo
13:19:28<Kita> And the sound/effect is soooo satisfying
13:19:39<Laevos> Mmf :3
13:19:45<Kita> Kita has stuck with her tried-and-trues
13:20:00<Kita> Ike and Link.
13:20:02<Laevos> How have they been holding up? :o
13:20:12<Laevos> Link seemed so fun in the demo :3
13:20:16<Kita> She hasn't unlocked R.O.B. yet.
13:20:21<Laevos> Aww
13:20:24<Kita> Link is better
13:20:31<Laevos> :33333
13:20:44<Kita> Compared to previous titles, he is better
13:20:56<Kita> Ike plays a little slower
13:20:58<Kita> ;.;
13:21:01<Laevos> That's what it seemed like
13:21:04<Laevos> and awwh :c
13:21:07<Laevos> Too slow?
13:21:18<Kita> Not too slow
13:21:34<Laevos> Just slow enough? :::o
13:21:43<Kita> His attacks have longer recovery times... Only a few frames
13:22:03<Laevos> Awwh
13:23:27<Laevos> But still pretty fun?
13:23:49<Kita> It is enough to make him vulnerable to fast characters like Pikachu and Fox
13:24:29<Laevos> Awwh

00:51:15<Kita> Reading a reddit thread about offensive Halloween costumes.
00:51:47 Laevos: nods
00:51:56<Kita> There is this shitty costume that has a bucket, a fake iPad, and a transparent blue curtain, with fake ice in it.
00:52:13<Laevos> Derp
00:52:24<Kita> Someone is saying put on a burka, carry a machete, and call yourself the "ISIS Bucket Challenge"
00:52:35<Laevos> wat
00:52:44<Laevos> That's dumb :c
00:52:49<Kita> Yeah. That is probably the best suggestion in the thread.

19:08:59<Kita> So Kita, and her current steady babe are gonna buckle into the reclining seats on the couch, and play through some old games.

19:56:44<Kita> This seems to be the same issue.
19:56:49<Laevos> Goddamn it Dx
19:57:05<Kita> Its either Kita's computer, or Lilith's server.
19:57:53<Laevos> Okay
19:57:57<Laevos> Hmm...
19:58:16<Laevos> leave it open for a sec
19:58:19<Laevos> I'm going to test something

05:42:48 Laevos: giggles and clings on~
05:42:48<Laevos> so
05:42:59<Laevos> my friend and I were out driving looking for places to film for his visual effects class
05:43:03<Laevos> it was too dark so we didn't find shit
05:43:04<Laevos> BUT
05:43:11<Laevos> we did find something else that he was looking for
05:43:20<Laevos> a CRT TV set that somebody had just thrown away
05:43:26<Laevos> perfect condition
05:43:37<Laevos> he wanted it for having something with no input lag
05:43:43<Laevos> and for better looking pixels on old games
05:43:51<Laevos> so we hauled it all over the place and finally got it back
05:43:57<Laevos> played some Mega Manx on it and some other games
05:47:05<Kita> o.o
05:47:09<Kita> :3
05:47:35<Laevos> It was fun
05:47:37<Laevos> but so tireddddddd

17:10:48<Kita> Yush
17:11:11<Laevos> Now, important question
17:11:16<Laevos> when are we watching this? :3
17:11:17<Kita> ?
17:11:19<Kita> X3
17:11:28<Kita> Not right now... Probably later this week?
17:11:32 Laevos: nods
17:11:39<Laevos> that works better for me as well
17:12:16<Kita> It depends. Kita has applied for some online jobs to fill her time with.
17:12:29<Laevos> Oh okay :3
17:12:35<Laevos> hope that goes well!
17:13:07 Kita: nods.
17:13:10<Kita> Kita is bored, a lot.
17:14:46<Laevos> awwh
17:15:08<Laevos> fair enough ;-; Goddess deserves something to keep away boredom Dx
17:15:35 Kita: nods.
17:15:58<Laevos> What kinds of jobs? :o
17:16:53<Kita> Data entry.
17:16:58 Laevos: nods
17:17:14<Kita> Kita likes charts and graphs and spreadsheets and their orderly form.
17:17:14<Kita> <3
17:18:44<Laevos> Yay :3
17:18:58<Laevos> such work sounds suitable for Goddess, then!
17:19:26<Kita> Kita has done data entry, before.
17:20:22<Laevos> Yay!
17:20:31<Laevos> Does Kita find it relaxing?
17:20:47<Kita> Kita finds fabricating structure to be relaxing, yes.
17:21:23<Laevos> Good <3 we can spreadsheet together someday :3
17:21:56<Kita> X3
17:22:06<Kita> Kita makes spreadsheets for Pokemon teams.
17:22:16<Laevos> Nice ~u~
17:22:29<Laevos> That must be Kita's secret to greatness
17:22:44<Laevos> and her unfathomable skill in Pokeromancy ;u;
17:23:04<Kita> Kita is also intensely aware of the gaming mechanics.
17:23:17<Laevos> This is true
17:23:20<Laevos> INTENSELY
17:24:48<Laevos> went shopping with my mom and sister
17:24:54<Laevos> bought a cute dress :3
17:25:15<Kita> Yay
17:25:26<Kita> Your mom and sister are supportive? Or tolerant?
17:25:50<Laevos> I dunno if they know the extent
17:26:03<Laevos> but they're supportive of me in general
17:26:10<Kita> n.n
17:26:37<Laevos> and I'm supportive of my sister and the stuff she does :3
17:26:59<Kita> n.n
17:27:44<Laevos> we're pretty close and bff-ish

22:30:24<Laevos> Just got back from the bank
22:30:32<Laevos> deposited a check to myself, have enough for projector
22:30:41<Kita> You have a bank open at this time of night?
22:30:51<Laevos> Kind of
22:31:22<Laevos> Bank of america has a "deposit room" where you can use your card to open up a locked door
22:31:26<Laevos> and use an ATM
22:31:34<Kita> Cool!
22:31:56<Kita> Kita has a silly Credit Union.
22:32:24<Laevos> to be honest
22:32:28<Laevos> I'd probably prefer a Credit Union
22:32:33<Laevos> Bank of America are pretty shithouse
22:32:35<Kita> o.o
22:32:37<Kita> Really?
22:32:39<Laevos> as well as
22:32:41<Laevos> evil ;-;
22:32:43<Kita> :<
22:32:54<Laevos> they're getting rid of the only type of checking account without a monthly fee
22:32:56<Kita> Credit Unions are, honestly, no less evil.
22:32:58<Laevos> (the kind I have)
22:33:04<Kita> Nevermind.
22:33:07<Kita> That is way more evil.
22:33:20<Laevos> yeah
22:33:29<Laevos> I know Credit Unions aren't like
22:33:42<Laevos> groups of saints devoting their lives to safeguarding people's money
22:33:53<Kita> They should be! D:<
22:33:55<Laevos> but BoA have done a lot of crap, bought their way out of quite a few lawsuits
22:34:01<Laevos> They should be :c
22:34:10<Kita> You should find a better bank.
22:34:12<Kita> ;.;
22:34:13 Laevos: nods
22:34:15<Laevos> planning on it
22:34:29<Kita> Kita has heard good things about Chase?
22:34:36<Laevos> That's what my mom uses
22:34:44<Kita> Oh yeah?
22:34:48<Laevos> uh-huh
22:34:59<Kita> That is an interesting coincidence.
22:35:00<Kita> X3
22:35:04 Kita: snickers.
22:35:09<Laevos> but she also has a BoA account for emergencies when it'd take too long to transfer money to one of my siblings or me quickly
22:35:14<Kita> Ah.
22:35:15<Laevos> like >_>
22:35:16<Laevos> if >_>
22:35:27<Laevos> my radiator explodes in the middle of West Virginia >_>

22:35:34<Kita> Did that happen
22:35:34<Kita> XD
22:35:44<Laevos> that was not fun xux
22:35:52<Kita> Probably not!
22:35:58<Kita> West Virginia is a shitty place.
22:36:02<Laevos> yeah
22:36:09<Laevos> I was trying to get to regular Virginia

15:58:23<Laevos> how're you? o:
15:58:28<Kita> Doing okay
15:58:37 Laevos: nods
15:58:40<Laevos> having a pretty good day so far :3
15:59:02<Kita> Oh yeah?
15:59:06<Kita> Whatcha doing?
16:00:38<Laevos> Just feeling pretty good! I had a surprise test in physics that I got over 100% on apparently
16:00:48<Kita> Nice.
16:00:50<Laevos> little bit tired but still good :3
16:01:01 Kita: rubs behind her ears.
16:01:05<Laevos> one of the problems involved finding the heat generated by a "love-fest" between two opposing Kansas congressional candidates
16:01:14<Laevos> which made me giggle a little
16:01:16<Kita> Pfff
16:01:41<Kita> Coefficient of friction, politicianfucker.
16:01:52 Kita: thinks that is a much worse insult.
16:02:33<Laevos> heat lost to inelastic collision
16:02:41<Laevos> and yeah
16:02:46<Kita> Boom
16:02:53<Kita> Sex heat
16:02:55<Laevos> ;3
16:04:14 Kita: wants to hear a dubstep remix of the Kalos Legendary theme, because Zygarde.
16:04:24<Laevos> that would be pretty neat-O
16:04:43<Kita> Thematically appropriate, given Zygarde's design.
16:04:59<Kita> It has that Hexpixel thing, going on.
16:05:15 Laevos: nods
16:09:38<Kita> Gonna get the demo for OR/AS?
16:09:42<Laevos> Mayyyyybe
16:09:49<Laevos> requires a preorder, right?
16:09:54<Kita> Just gotta sign up for the Trainer Club Newsletter.
16:09:59<Laevos> Oh o:
16:10:01<Kita> No pre-order necessary.
16:10:20<Laevos> Yay :D
16:10:21<Kita> Make you sure you allow them to e-mail you things, and you'll get it, if you sign up before the 20th.
16:10:23<Laevos> Then I just might!
16:10:56<Kita> Accidental /whois
16:10:58<Kita> But
16:11:01<Kita> Plurality?
16:11:10<Laevos> uh-huh
16:11:20<Laevos> that channel is usually completely empty
16:11:22<Laevos> and completely silent
16:11:22<Kita> What does that channel entail?
16:11:28<Laevos> used to use it to talk to some friends
16:11:34<Laevos> who are no longer on good terms with one another
16:11:38<Kita> :<
16:11:39<Laevos> just haven't removed it from my autojoin

16:11:59<Laevos> THEN THE NUMBERS FOR OTHER CHANNELS WOULD BE DIFFERENT
16:12:01<Laevos> uhh
16:12:20<Laevos> also seldom used, used to be a kind of dumb Facebook group made up of some random Metal Archives users
16:12:26<Laevos> they've migrated to Skype
16:12:29<Kita> And Cute?
16:12:34<Kita> Does it actually have cutes
16:12:35<Laevos> it's for posting cute things
16:12:36<Kita> Or is it
16:12:39<Kita> Oh.
16:12:42<Laevos> or
16:12:43<Laevos> for being cute
16:12:44<Laevos> whatever you want
16:12:48<Laevos> ...it's usually idle, too ~u~
16:12:52 Kita: pokes her head in there to idle.
16:12:54<Laevos> Okay!
16:13:09 Kita: refuses to be part of a solution.
16:13:12<Laevos> >u>
16:13:13<Laevos> It's okay

16:13:24<Laevos> I'm active in e nough channels
16:13:41<Laevos> the other ones are there, again, to keep my irssi shortcuts to what I remember them to be

22:42:57<Kita> Kita likes the middle claws longer...
22:43:12<Kita> And the dewclaws shorter than the rest.
22:44:28 Laevos: nods, keeping the extra length and shortening wherever necessary, respectively, before moving to do the same on her other hand.

00:08:37<Laevos> I've had a very productive day @_@
00:08:48<Kita> Oh yes?
00:10:11<Laevos> Kind of by force, lots of tests this week, got me into efficient mode, got up early, made myself lunch, had breakfast, got lots done at work, studied for my test tomorrow (or today I should say now) and got a fair bit of research done for my honor's thesis/added about 600 words to my annotated bibliography @_@
00:10:30<Kita> n.n
00:11:29<Laevos> And took advantage of a spooky Halloween freeleech on a private tracker I use
00:11:35<Laevos> got my ratio  up to 5.002
00:11:51<Kita> o.o
00:12:21<Laevos> and application stuff for grad school
00:12:35<Laevos> I kind of wanted to ask >_>
00:12:37<Laevos> >________________>
00:12:49<Kita> o.o
00:13:16<Laevos> if Goddess lives close to Seattle, is there any chance that I could perhaps commute from there to the mandatory three-day orientation thing next Fall if I get into this program? The rest of it is online just that part I need to be in the state for @_@
00:13:25<Laevos> and thought I'd ask just in case Q_Q
00:13:46 Kita: freezes
00:13:50<Kita> Maybe.
00:13:59<Laevos> If not, is okay <3
00:14:10<Laevos> Lilith has lots of time to figure things out
00:14:12<Kita> Kita is still not ready for that.
00:14:17<Laevos> and I know it'd be asking a lot from you, Goddess
00:14:20<Laevos> I understand <3
00:14:56<Laevos> if at any point over the next... well, year, almost, that changes, feel free to let me know, otherwise, is fine and I'll figure something out <3
00:15:35 Kita: nods
00:16:35<Laevos> Was looking at my university's website today, checking staff job openings just to see what's out there
00:16:48<Laevos> find one that I could do, seem well-qualified for, is full time, pays well...
00:16:52<Laevos> ...the catch...
00:17:01<Laevos> location: Off-Campus (Alaska)
00:17:04<Laevos> T_T Why
00:17:07<Kita> ;.;
00:17:43<Laevos> yeah sure I'll just pack up and head on out to some data/research center in a FROZEN WASTELAND Q_Q
00:18:14<Laevos> Unsurprisingly, the posting is still up even though it's been quite a bit since they were supposed to close it to look at applicants
00:18:33<Laevos> I guess it'd be an adventure... >u>

20:42:53<Laevos> Maybe you'll recognize it
20:44:42<Kita> It is familiar...

12:44:17 Laevos: licks :3
12:44:26<Kita> Hi
12:45:52<Laevos> How are you?
12:46:02<Kita> Irritated
12:46:15<Laevos> Reddit stuff?
12:46:30<Kita> It is bullshit seeing people defend the admins.
12:46:42 Laevos: nods x~x
12:46:47<Laevos> It sounds like it.
12:47:13<Kita> Oh, controversial sub goes to complete shit after we make a change...?
12:47:34<Kita> Shit, that sub ALIENATED users. Can't have that up, better let it shit all over itself.
12:48:14<Laevos> Oops
12:48:24<Laevos> derp T_T
12:48:34<Kita> r/atheism was a good sub
12:48:43<Kita> People called it circlejerky
12:48:50<Kita> But it never was really circlejerky.
12:49:12<Laevos> Was it a good *sub* though? Did it wear its gag out in public and everything?
12:49:22<Laevos> And I'll take your word for it
12:49:27<Kita> There were a lot of clickbait posts, but most of those were deflated in the comments, and were upvoted for the discussion that occured in the comments.
12:49:38<Kita> Not the actual bait itself.
12:49:41<Laevos> Yeah
12:49:52<Kita> Which was cool.
12:50:24<Laevos> Yay
12:50:26<Laevos> but then...?
12:50:41 Kita: points to #Pepper
12:50:57<Laevos> Oh yeah
12:51:09<Kita> u/jij usurped the sub by taking advantage of an old sub leadership rule.
12:51:16<Laevos> Yeah :/
12:51:20<Laevos> sounds dumb
12:51:41<Kita> He had the founder removed from the mod list due to inactivity, despite the fact that the user was an active member under another account.
12:51:54<Kita> Who then immediately petitioned for his reinstatement.
12:52:04<Kita> But was turned down and never given a reason why.
12:52:29<Kita> u/jij was probably offered heavy modship for alt-accounts by the admins for usurping and killing the sub.
12:52:50<Laevos> Welp
12:52:55<Laevos> looks like it's ruined forever :c
12:53:05<Kita> r/atheism? Yeah.
12:53:35<Laevos> Time to jump ship?
12:53:43<Kita> It happened a year ago.
12:53:50<Kita> The most recent folly of the admins...
12:53:56<Laevos> Oh okay
12:53:58<Kita> Remember those leaked celebrity nudes?
12:54:06<Laevos> Yeah
12:54:11<Kita> Yeah... Someone created a subreddit for them.
12:54:19<Laevos> ...
12:54:34<Laevos> Was it a honeypot to ban everyone who shared them?
12:54:38<Laevos> (I already know the answer)
12:55:01<Kita> And it persisted, existed, and shit all over the idea of privacy and decency for over a week before Reddit finally decided to censor the thumbnails.
12:55:14<Laevos> Whoops.
12:55:18<Kita> It was almost two weeks before they banned the images, and killed the sub altogether.
12:55:30<Laevos> ...
12:55:41<Kita> But they never took action against the subscribers and creators of the sub.
12:55:53<Laevos> What a surprise, to nobody. :/
12:56:17<Kita> Why did it take so long?
12:56:26<Kita> "Don't wanna censor free speech"
12:56:29<Laevos> lol
12:56:32<Laevos> okay
12:56:53<Laevos> Yeah I'm sorry but fuck the very existence of that site. :/
12:57:20<Laevos> That does nothing to change my perception of it as a place for hate groups to safely convene without fear of consequence for their disgusting actions.
12:57:27<Kita> Despite the fact that during some twitch.tv drama, they helped censor EVERYTHING negative about the leadership of twitch.tv, and then later during the whole Depression Quest creator drama, censored anything positive or supportive of the creator.
12:57:42<Kita> The problem is that there is a lot of good content and good people there.
12:57:47<Laevos> Yeah I don't care
12:57:53<Laevos> it pales in comparison to the inexcusable shit that comes out of there.
12:58:13<Kita> r/FemmeThoughts is a private sub, which acts as the sub for women voicing their ideas to other women.
12:58:31<Kita> Including things like criticising other subs and admin decisions.
12:58:33<Laevos> They'd be a necessary loss in its destruction. They should find a better place to make a community that isn't actively hostile toward them outside of their private space.
12:58:43<Laevos> Fuck the entire site. Death to Reddit.
12:59:35<Kita> Or how about...
12:59:42<Kita> Change of admin leadership?
12:59:54<Kita> So we can keep all the good stuff and purge the bad.
12:59:57<Laevos> Some things are beyond salvaging...
12:59:58<Kita> That is an option.
13:00:22<Laevos> I mean you're the one who uses the site and has a stake in it, how you deal with it is your choice. 
13:00:53<Laevos> But I'll maintian that they're beyond any salvation other than total annihilation.
13:01:34<Laevos> Like trying to save the few scraps of healthy cells from a body which is now mostly a solid mass of cancerous tissue. A living tumor more than a human.
13:02:01<Laevos> At what point does one say "mercy" and pull the plug?
13:02:36<Kita> The issue is that with proper surgical tools, we can excise the tumor and actually save the body.
13:02:59<Laevos> Well, if you believe there's enough of a "body" left to actually save, then that's your business.
13:03:02<Kita> Because "forget about it" isn't an option.
13:03:05<Laevos> It's... not possible for me to believe that, though.
13:03:23<Laevos> By all means, do your best if you think you can make a difference
13:03:26<Kita> Considering that subs like r/atheismrebooted, r/FemmeThoughts, and r/Pokemon exist?
13:04:23<Laevos> It seems like trying to dredge up the gold-leaf flakes out of an ocean of tightly-packed excrement... but I wish you luck. :/
13:04:37<Laevos> Of course it could be wonderful if change like you describe would actually be possible
13:04:46<Laevos> and if you believe it is, you should work to achieve it, however you can.
13:04:47<Kita> (Funny thing about r/Pokemon? Minimalistic mod-policy, removes racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, overtly and offensively religious, and age separatist posts...
13:04:50<Kita> )
13:05:04<Kita> And little to no drama
13:05:14<Laevos> It's not a fight that I'll have time devoting myself to, however...
13:05:18<Laevos> And yeah, that sounds fine, sure.
13:05:53<Laevos> If anyone can save that place, it's you, Goddess. <3
13:06:18<Laevos> You and others like you who have the dedication and devotion to that platform in particular to think it worth trying to salvage.
13:07:14<Laevos> I'll be happy if you succeed, and wouldn't dream of being haughty otherwise. Do what you believe in, Goddess. <3
13:08:01<Laevos> As for me...

13:38:00<Kita> Though Kita would like to say that Tumblr is bad for the opposite reasons.
13:38:42<Kita> Minority individuals hold too much swaying power in Tumblr, creating a Tumblr-culture of victimisation.
13:39:01<Kita> Silencing the majority through fallacial argument and the like.
13:39:06<Kita> A much, much easier fix, though.
13:39:26 Laevos: shrugs
13:39:32<Laevos> probz
13:39:39<Laevos> but I like pretty pictures
13:39:40<Laevos> and uh
13:39:49<Laevos> music stuff
13:40:05<Kita> When you can silence an entire demographic by shouting "SHUT UP WHITE CIS MALE, YOU CAN'T COMPLAIN UNTIL WE CAN'T COMPLAIN"
13:40:15<Laevos> that's about it... I have no idea what goes on with *bigger* tumbl blogs
13:40:20<Kita> Then yeah... something is definitely broken.
13:40:21<Kita> o.o
13:40:33<Laevos> I always support telling white cis males to shut up, to be fair...
13:40:39<Laevos> they don't even have to be saying anything
13:40:39<Laevos> just
13:40:42<Kita> Kita doesn't.
13:40:43<Kita> :|
13:40:48<Laevos> just 'cause
13:40:50<Laevos> (2)
13:40:56<Kita> Kita's bro is white, cis, and male.
13:41:03<Laevos> That's okay
13:41:18<Kita> That doesn't make his opinions or advice any less or more valid.
13:41:35<Laevos> On certain things it does rly
13:41:37<Laevos> like
13:42:00<Laevos> his input on a discussion on the lived experiences of trans* folks would be... worth a lot less than the experiences of the people who actually live that reality.
13:43:39<Kita> His input on those discussions is normally "Hey, a person is a person. Male, female, something else, something in-between... Doesn't matter. You wanna be a girl? Go be a girl. You wanna be a guy? Go be a guy. You wanna be something else? Go be something else. It's all good."
13:44:01<Laevos> That's all magical and sparkly
13:44:07<Laevos> but... kind of worthless in an actual discussion :/
13:44:20<Laevos> Because it most certainly is /not/ all good
13:44:47<Kita> He only says things like that when his opinion is asked...
13:45:02<Laevos> That's fine
13:45:08<Kita> And in discussions of "would you date a transgirl"...
13:45:21<Kita> Which, for him, is a legitimate question to ask him...
13:45:33<Kita> Because he is a heterosexual male
13:46:26<Laevos> Again, fine...
13:46:29<Kita> His first response when he was asked that question... Asked by Kita, funnily enough was... "If I liked her, sure. What does being trans have to do with it?"
13:46:47<Kita> His input is legitimate and valid.
13:46:55<Laevos> but it doesn't really contest the fact that white cis guys' opinions in discussions that /don't concern them/ are worth /less/, if not /worthless/.
13:47:19<Laevos> If you ask somebody about their dating preferences, that concerns them, sure.
13:47:45<Laevos> but that's not exactly an important discussion regarding... actual issues. I mean it can be a good indicator for the atmosphere/safety of a place
13:47:51<Laevos> but
13:47:55<Kita> If they are educated in the discussion, Kita doesn't see how it makes their argument worth less... Especially if the people of whatever minority topics are being discussed are firmly uneducated in the matter.
13:48:25<Laevos> They don't live in that reality...
13:48:30<Kita> Such as a discussion on the anthropology of trans-acceptance...
13:48:55<Laevos> by virtue of the nature of their existence, they can never really be a part of that community, and, to a certain extent, their ideas and thoughts about that community will be less valuable.
13:49:24<Laevos> In any case
13:49:44<Laevos> ...most of the input of white cis guys isn't presented in an educated, informed, respecting, or even coherent way, when it comes to these issues.
13:49:56<Laevos> So it's no surprise that the communities involved would become a bit jaded to their stupid shit.
13:50:15<Laevos> And eventually just get to the point where they tell people like that to fuck right off and mind their own business.
13:50:26<Kita> But it is definitely a logical fallacy to invoke what is essentially the reverse of the No True Scotsman fallacy.
13:50:41<Laevos> And they can bitch and moan about "not all men" or how they're a special magical snowflake all they want
13:51:08<Laevos> but sometimes it's the better option to not try and get in a fight with people who have been damaged by those kind of people and just... take their advice and... leave.
13:52:00<Kita> But that is inherently separatist, which is hypocritical of the movement in essence.
13:52:01<Kita> :<
13:52:24<Kita> Sure, remove assholes in the discussion...
13:52:39<Kita> But White+Cis+Male != Asshole.
13:52:39<Laevos> It sure ain't. It's not hypocritical to want a safe space where people who are representative of an oppressive group make others in the conversation feel unsafe.
13:53:10<Kita> Unless those people are your allies?
13:53:16<Laevos> Is it always "fair" that a person like that should be told that their presence is triggering and asked to leave? No, it's not.
13:53:23<Laevos> But you know what's less fair?
13:53:49<Laevos> The entire system of existence in which we currently find outselves as lived out by the people who /don't/ have the fortune of being the "default class."
13:53:54<Laevos> i.e., the privileged one.
13:54:37<Kita> Excluding the "privileged one" only serves to alienate them and feed the ignorance that created the phenomenon in the first place.
13:54:38<Laevos> Some idea of "fairness" does not override the need for emotional safety and space that individuals in these discussions may have.
13:54:38<Kita> :<
13:55:04<Laevos> They should seek out their own education.
13:55:18<Laevos> It's not the job of people who have to put up with uneducated idiots every single day to enlighten every single one
13:55:20<Laevos> fuck that.
13:56:02<Kita> No, but it is the job of people to make the information to cure ignorance easily and readily available, and also present in an anti-separatist view.
13:56:08<Laevos> If they're an actual ally,  they'll be respectful, leave when they know their presence is triggering, and do their own research to find things out, not  make demands to be babied by a group where the shared level of knowledge on the subject is a bit higher.
13:56:15<Laevos> No it's not...
13:56:26<Laevos> They have no obligation to provide anything...
13:56:33<Laevos> and if they're not willing to do that, fuck them.
13:56:48<Laevos> A shallow "ally" like that isn't wanted or needed.
13:57:02<Kita> Nonono...
13:57:13<Kita> If you want to be accepted, you have to be accepting.
13:57:19<Kita> You can oppose oppression...
13:57:29<Kita> But you cannot alienate the unintentional oppressors.
13:57:44<Kita> To do so is to remove potential allies from the cause.
13:58:00<Laevos> Oh please. Setting off someobdy's anxiety just so you can be part of the discussion does not make you a good ally, potential or otherwise.
13:58:49<Laevos> There needs to be a concept of things like "women's space", and "trans space".
13:59:07<Laevos> It's not the same as setting up some sepratist community and trying to live off the grid or some shit like that
13:59:22<Laevos> it's a matter of having somewhere where you can feel safe, and not have to deal with the anxiety or stress of dealing with people that trigger you.
13:59:37<Laevos> /Obviously/ there will be discussions that need to involve everybody
13:59:40<Laevos> that'll be /most/ discussions
13:59:45<Laevos> especially ones where the intent is to change policy
14:00:15<Laevos> but that doesn't mean that there shouldn't be safe spaces where people can exist without fear of being assaulted, because even if somebody really is an ally, that anxiety and suffering can still be there.
14:00:48<Laevos> Like, I don't even identify as a male, but if somebody told me that my presence was setting off their androphobia, do you think I'd get pissed off and start yelling at them or telling them why they /shouldn't/ be triggered by me?
14:00:59<Laevos> No, that would be the opposite of productive/sensible.
14:01:06<Kita> No, because that is a completely irrational response.
14:01:18<Laevos> I would leave, and try to find a way to introduce a more comfortable environment at a later time
14:01:25<Laevos> or just avoid them if there's no way around it, for their own safety.
14:01:56<Kita> That should be an extreme minority of cases, but Kita sees it exploited to fuel a new form of bigotry.
14:02:14<Laevos> Ehh...
14:02:26<Kita> A call for knights to pick up their swords and shields, because oh shit, we have a goblin in the house.
14:03:21<Kita> One should not be able to point and go "You're triggering me" and expect a zero discourse surrender and departure, for all instances.
14:03:25<Laevos> I don't see it that way. The most backlash I see from it is white dudes crying that they're being oppressed when they're usually being asses in the first place; honestly I've never seen a case of somebody just being excommunicated because of their white cisness.
14:03:39<Laevos> I've literally only ever seen it when the guy in question was already being an asshole.
14:03:54<Laevos> So... it's hard for me to believe that it's anything like 'bigotry' in any sense of the word.
14:04:46<Kita> Anti-male individuals do exist, as do anti-White, and anti-cis.
14:05:20<Laevos> Perhaps, but I think their presence and clout is way over-stated by reactionary white dudes who take any frustrated blog post they can find and blow it out of proportion into an ANTI-MALE CONSPIRACY
14:05:26<Laevos> which I have seen happen, dozens of times.
14:05:39<Kita> Sure, there are bad eggs in both groups.
14:06:07<Laevos> But I'll contend that the oppressor group has them in much higher numbers, and their actions cause significantly more harm
14:06:16<Laevos> not just emotionally, but physically
14:06:25<Laevos> like, to the extent of people actually dying.
14:06:26<Kita> Proportionally, it is actually probably similar numbers.
14:06:43<Laevos> All the angry blog-posts in the world don't mean shit against /actual death./
14:06:56<Laevos> /Actual/ violence against women and trans* indivudials
14:07:16<Laevos> not just a nebulous concept of "people are being mean and not wanting me to participate in their discussion on the Internet :c"
14:07:37<Kita> There is actually violence against everyone of every denomination, and Kita doesn't believe in putting any one of them higher than another.
14:07:49<Laevos> There is not systematic violence against men by anyone but other men.
14:08:16<Kita> Kita would not say that. Kita would say there is significantly less, but definitely not zero.
14:08:27<Laevos> Isolated incidents do not a global, overwhelming trend make.
14:08:45<Kita> No, but isolated incidents are what start trends.
14:08:52<Kita> The real goal is ending all violence.
14:09:14<Laevos> If you think there's a credible threat of violence against men as a cause of anything but the male-dominated system that we currently live in and by other men...
14:09:18<Laevos> we live in two very different worlds.
14:09:44<Kita> Kita did say that there was definitely significantly less threat of violence.
14:09:57<Kita> The real value is probably miniscule.
14:10:16<Kita> But to say that it doesn't exist at all is to be favoritist.
14:10:42<Laevos> If you can show me even one incident of such, then I'll concede that it exists.
14:10:52<Laevos> Until then...
14:11:28<Kita> Well, the Black Panthers were a dual-gender anti-Caucasian group who were relatively violent, in comparison to many of the other groups at their peak time.
14:11:33<Laevos> it's not something that'll even enter into my thoughts, really... and even if it does exist, scale matters... the ability to do these things /so much more/ and with so far great results
14:11:37<Kita> The Black Panthers still exist, indeed.
14:11:56<Laevos> *so far greater
14:12:08<Laevos> is what defines a dominant group, in part...
14:12:51<Laevos> and if your main point of argument here is that there are a non-zero number of incidents where men have been harmed because of their maleness... that doesn't exactly stack up very well.
14:13:09<Kita> And Kita is definitely acknowledging that violence against men by non-men is definitely not eclipsing of violence against non-men by men...
14:13:10<Laevos> It's not really valid to say that because both of the sides have > 0 casualties, their plight is the same.
14:13:23<Kita> And Kita never claimed their plight to be the same.
14:13:27<Laevos> Or even comparable... or that both sides even /have/ a "plight"
14:13:42<Kita> Only that violence transcends the gender boundaries.
14:13:56<Kita> And that ending violent behaviours solves the problem all around?
14:14:11<Kita> Instead of focusing on eliminating specific violences.
14:14:51<Kita> Does that make more sense?
14:15:05<Laevos> Obviously there should not be violence. But it's foolhardy to ignore the source of the vast majority of the violence. Let's say we take a unisex approach, 50% directed toward men and 50% toward non-men
14:15:19<Kita> Okay
14:15:19<Laevos> In such a case, there is effort /wasted/
14:15:45<Laevos> because the maximum potential gain of one of those 50%s is nearly insignificant compared to the possibility of putting more resources into the first.
14:16:46<Laevos> Because it is statistically obvious that a great and overwhelming majority of this violence comes from men, and I would argue is produced (even in non-men) by the tendencies of a male-dominated, capitalist soceity.
14:17:19<Laevos> Treating both sides as though they're equally culpable... doesn't make sense when you look at the actual numbers of actual incidents, not just a vague idea that there's some on both sides...
14:17:29<Kita> Kita would argue that patriarchal society is indeed a factor, but definitely not capitalism.
14:17:39<Laevos> I'd say it's almost more capitalism
14:17:45<Kita> Howso?
14:17:53<Laevos> the idea of competition, introducing the idea of "winners" and "losers" in a soceity
14:18:04<Laevos> creating greater demands of need by which people are forced into more and more squalid conditions
14:18:18<Laevos> /that's/ something that produces not just violence, but all kinds of crime and anti-social behaviors.
14:18:58<Kita> "Winners" and "losers" is not an idea of capitalism, but actually an understanding of species prosperity, albeit a relatively underdeveloped one.
14:18:59<Laevos> It makes humanity a zero-sum game.
14:19:32<Kita> Winners and losers definitely existed before capitalism and free-market economies were a thing.
14:19:37<Kita> And violence did, too.
14:19:39<Laevos> Competition of the kind that capitalism introduces makes it so that a requisite factor of one's success is a failure of others.
14:20:00<Kita> That is more a failure of free-market economy.
14:20:05<Laevos> Yes, they did, but they've since been made all the more widespread; note that by 'violence' I mean not just physical violence, but oppression in general.
14:20:10<Kita> Capitalism is not inherently free-market.
14:20:14<Laevos> I know
14:20:21<Laevos> I /especially/ oppose free-market capitalism
14:20:22<Laevos> but...
14:20:33<Laevos> I do not believe in supplanting it with another form of capitalism, at all.
14:20:46<Kita> Not that Kita is saying capitalism is the best form of economics.
14:21:11<Laevos> I think it's necessary for the development of human soceity that it be excised and replaced, really. :/
14:21:14<Kita> Capitalism is a step in the right direction? Creating cyclical economies is certainly not sustainable.
14:21:30<Laevos> A step in the right direction from?
14:21:34<Laevos> Feudalism?
14:21:43<Kita> From anywhere.
14:22:11<Laevos> I dunno, G.
14:22:17<Kita> Certain principals of Communism are unsustainable.
14:22:39<Kita> And capitalism was a 200 year system, and we've extended it to something like... 600?
14:22:57<Kita> Which says a lot to its merit!
14:23:02<Laevos> That may be (depending on what you think those to be), but the very nature of a capitalist system ensures that it will destroy both itself and a myriad of lives in the process...
14:23:15<Laevos> It's sustained itself on the backs of countless exploited working class individuals...
14:23:21<Kita> Yes, if you do not develop beyond it.
14:23:34<Kita> But capitalism is what works in a scarcity economy.
14:23:42<Laevos> That it 'sustains' the existence of well-off individuals does not excuse the great human and environmental toll it's taken upon the earth...
14:23:45<Kita> (We no longer live in a scarcity economy, though.)
14:24:04<Kita> Well, yeah.
14:24:14<Kita> We live in a post-scarcity economic period.
14:24:37<Kita> Capitalism has no ability to develop further in a post-scarcity situation.
14:24:42<Laevos> I would look at the 600-year lifespan of this system more with a sense of horror rather than find any merit in the fact that it's been able to sustain itself for so long.
14:24:47<Kita> Its entire premise is based on scarcity itself.
14:25:01<Laevos> Yeah, to the point where it introduces artifical scarcity to maintain that...
14:25:13<Kita> Which is why it worked then, and doesn't now.
14:25:24<Laevos> Sure
14:25:45<Kita> It got us here. Now we need to move on from it.
14:26:11<Kita> But severe and polar shifts in economic systems are certainly not the answer.
14:26:14<Laevos> I don't disagree that it was an improvement on the things that came before it, though I wouldn't say that it was the ideal course of development; it made the systems of exploitation more abstract, which profits some but also makes it harder to show to others, and to uproot
14:26:39<Kita> The idea is to fluidly transition.
14:26:41<Laevos> Well, I don't, for example, support total conversions in economies that are not equipped to support it yet
14:26:49<Kita> Yeah
14:26:50<Laevos> The USSR wasn't ready for what it was trying to do
14:26:55<Laevos> China wasn't ready for what it was trying to do
14:26:58<Kita> Most certainly not.
14:27:04<Kita> And Kita was about to bring up BOTH.
14:27:05<Kita> XP
14:27:07<Laevos> Uguu~
14:27:30<Laevos> No, I agree that a transition needs to be done well, and in the scope of a soceity that supports it as an instigator
14:27:36<Kita> But look at the Danish, Swedish, and Norwegian economies~
14:27:53<Laevos> but it also needs to eventually be something a bit more worldwide, so that we don't end up with another iron curtain.
14:29:22<Kita> There is a lot of opposition in the states due to ignorance and fear-mongering.
14:29:31<Laevos> Yup
14:30:08<Laevos> It doesn't come as much of a surprise; those who have profited most through the free market don't want a more equitable system, in large part.
14:30:32<Laevos> It profits them, personally, more to keep things as they are, not that there aren't successful people who are aware of this and suppose our current joke of a system :c
14:30:36<Kita> Which is strange? Because it actually serves to benefit them in wake of a disasterous occurence.
14:30:41<Laevos> Sure
14:30:44<Laevos> in the long-term
14:30:56<Laevos> but a lot of this free-market stuff is more about short-term gain
14:31:03<Laevos> immediate, visible, quarterly profit margins
14:31:13<Kita> Which doesn't create sustainable economic practices.
14:31:17<Laevos> Indeed not
14:31:43<Laevos> I believe that things will get better, though
14:31:47<Laevos> they might not ever get "best", but
14:32:12<Laevos> in general I believe in human nature and the ability of humans to improve their quality of life through ways mutually beneficial and empathetic to those around them
14:32:44<Laevos> "Fuck humans" "our soceity is coming to an end because of [         ]" arguments give me a headache :/
14:33:00<Kita> Sure. We're capable of understanding abstract, objective morality.
14:33:05<Laevos> I like people, and I think we can change things for the better.
14:33:33<Laevos> I think a lot of the ills we currently face are the result of some rather poor, short-sighted decisions, the rammafications of which probably couldn't have really been seen at the time... but whose aftermath still affects us today
14:34:08<Kita> Such as the support of supply-side economics, when demand-side economics is CLEARLY the superior system.
14:34:27<Laevos> Hehehehe
14:38:29<Laevos> Also
14:38:42<Laevos> going to be sociable tomorrow and go to Adult Lego Club at the public library
14:39:26<Laevos> Because LEGO bricks

20:30:42<Laevos> from
20:30:43<Laevos> PASTA
20:30:53<Laevos> my friend made some alfredo and didn't have cooking brandy
20:31:08<Laevos> so he just used regular brandy
20:31:09<Laevos> like
20:31:10<Laevos> 40 proof
20:31:12<Laevos> I feel weird
20:31:15<Laevos> I don't like this

20:31:23<Kita> o.o
20:31:30<Kita> Lilith
20:31:48<Kita> If you boiled it or simmered it, you cooked out the alcohol.
20:31:50<Kita> -.-
20:31:56<Kita> You're doing it to yourself.
20:32:28<Laevos> it wasn't boiled or simmered
20:32:31<Laevos> it was baked yo
20:32:39<Laevos> and there was apparently like a whole bottle in there
20:33:07<Kita> Baked, to.
20:33:17<Laevos> @_@
20:33:29<Kita> Don't you know the boiling point of ethanol? It evaporates at room temperature
20:33:30<Laevos> I had the effects happening before they told me what was in it, I asked about it
20:33:44<Kita> Lilith, no.
20:33:50<Kita> Alcohol doesn't work that way.
20:34:36<Laevos> okay
20:34:48<Kita> You're fine.
20:34:48<Laevos> if you say so, chief @_@
20:35:06<Kita> You need to quit panicking at the drop of a dime.
20:35:47<Laevos> I'm not so much panicking as
20:35:49<Laevos> feel really weird

20:10:05 Kita: licks.
20:10:12 Laevos: licks the lick
20:10:37<Kita> Doing okay!
20:10:45<Kita> Revamped the job sitch, today.
20:10:56<Kita> Got a good indica strain...
20:11:08<Laevos> Oh? o:
20:11:13<Kita> Chilling to some of the more relaxed music in Kita's collection...
20:11:15<Kita> High...
20:11:30<Laevos> :3
20:11:37<Kita> And inputing numbers into spreadsheets with almost stunning precision for the speed.
20:11:42<Kita> And the inebriated state.
20:11:43<Laevos> Nice ~u~
20:11:53<Laevos> We had a friend over from out of town
20:12:00<Kita> Oh?
20:12:02<Laevos> and it was fun
20:12:03<Laevos> uh-huh
20:12:14 Kita: rubs her hair.
20:12:20<Laevos> they helped set up some color-changing LEDs that I got from IKEA
20:12:30<Laevos> and we had a not-really-a-rave rave xux
20:12:31<Kita> o.O
20:12:34<Kita> X3
20:12:48<Laevos> since we went to the record store and found some 2LP mix of electronic music
20:12:49<Laevos> for like $3
20:12:52<Laevos> and decided WHY NOT
20:12:58<Kita> o.o
20:13:04<Laevos> it was amusing
20:13:05<Laevos> I...
20:13:07<Kita> Was it any good?
20:13:08<Laevos> swayed around and
20:13:09<Laevos> fell over
20:13:16<Kita> Swayed around?
20:13:22<Laevos> danced I think it's called
20:13:24<Laevos> >u>
20:13:25<Kita> Fell over? Are you alright?
20:13:26<Kita> X3
20:14:11<Laevos> Hehehe
20:14:18<Laevos> music and flashing lights and stuff made me all dizzy
20:14:41<Laevos> luckily we had blankets and pillows set up all over the floor
20:14:43<Laevos> in a little nest
20:14:47<Laevos> so I had something to fall over on
20:14:53<Laevos> and I wasn't even the one who took the drugs >_>
20:14:56<Laevos> *frailvos*
20:15:38<Kita> x3

20:15:56<Kita> :<
20:15:58<Laevos> :cc
20:16:02<Laevos> my friend
20:16:12<Laevos> they got some DXM
20:16:25<Laevos> and then left it here with the implication that I should use the rest of it
20:16:34<Kita> Oh. OH.
20:16:47<Kita> Deadhead?
20:16:53<Kita> That shit is rough.
20:16:54<Kita> o.o;
20:17:10<Kita> Not a fun time, if you trip bad.
20:17:51<Laevos> @_@
20:18:05<Laevos> they took stuff so it wouldn't make them barf in my house >_>
20:18:20<Kita> o.o
20:18:54<Laevos> and they didn't!
20:19:41<Kita> Good!
20:19:55<Kita> So wait... DXM? Uhh... Kita is unfamilir.
20:19:59<Kita> unfamiliar*
20:20:12<Kita> Kita is familiar with DMT, which is what she commented on as being rough.
20:20:17<Laevos> oh no

20:21:46<Kita> Oh.
20:21:50<Kita> Robitussin.
20:21:52<Kita> Got it.
20:22:01 Laevos: nods
20:22:57<Kita> He may have just left it there because it is cough syrup.
20:23:11<Kita> And if you get an itchy throat, its just cough syrup.
20:23:13<Kita> o.o
20:23:25<Kita> Did he drink half the bottle, or something?
20:23:28<Laevos> ya
20:23:39<Laevos> it was explicitly bought for the purposes of tripping on
20:23:49<Kita> Hm
20:24:01<Kita> Did he get Watermelon Arizona and some skittles?
20:24:04<Laevos> no omg
20:24:13<Kita> Good, that shit gets you shot.
20:24:14<Kita> :P
20:24:26<Laevos> And *she, sorry; trans* girl we know
20:24:41<Kita> Ah.
20:24:43<Kita> Well
20:24:45<Kita> Still
20:24:47<Laevos> yeah :3
20:25:08<Kita> Watermelon Arizona, Skittles, and Robitussin gets you shot.
20:25:41<Laevos> yeah that's something dumb teenagers do around here :c
20:25:58<Laevos> though she did get Skittles at a different point in time, BUT THOSE WERE FOR EATING
20:26:01<Laevos> not drugs...ing
20:26:26<Kita> Actually the Skittles have more to do with flavour.
20:26:39<Laevos> And the Arizona?
20:26:55<Kita> The Arizona is for drugsing
20:27:32<Kita> The preservatives in the juice, and the carbonation help activate the... DXM...
20:27:32<Laevos> Oh okay

01:56:57 Laevos: can't stop listening to a power metal-ish album that she hasn't listened to for years >w>
01:57:31<Kita> o.o
01:57:32<Kita> ?
01:59:08<Laevos> Demons & Wizards' self-titled
01:59:39<Kita> Oh!
02:00:08<Laevos> Kita knows them, perhaps? o:
02:00:18 Kita: nods.
02:00:26<Kita> The name is certainly familiar.
02:00:35 Kita: flips through her older CD collection.
02:00:49<Laevos> It's a side project of a member of Iced Earth and one from Blind Guardian
02:00:55<Laevos> (Neither of which Lilith has really listened to)
02:01:02<Laevos> (but they're fairly well-known I think)
02:01:22<Kita> !!
02:01:31<Kita> Kita REALLY likes Iced Earth.
02:01:37<Laevos> :3
02:01:49<Kita> Blind Guardian is good, but it doesn't strike Kita's personal chords like Iced Earth does.
02:01:53<Laevos> Yeah
02:02:03<Laevos> I'd need to look up which member is from which
02:02:15<Laevos> there's the vocalist and the rhythm guitarist (who does all the guitars for Demons & Wizards)
02:02:34<Laevos> They go together quite well I think :3

03:44:08<Laevos> Iggnsthe: Y-You should have given up, oni-chan~!
03:44:08<Laevos> Haunted Silver: DSG-kun you can do it
03:44:08<Laevos> ★Dark Sage Green: Clair's a girl though ;=; I can't be oni-chan
03:44:08<Laevos> Haunted Silver: Just remember from your losses
03:44:08<Laevos> Haunted Silver: *Oh god I can't english
03:44:08<Laevos> Haunted Silver left.
03:44:08<Laevos> Iggnsthe: D-Don't tell me what you can and can't be, oni-chan~! ♥

13:33:12<Kita> Hi
13:33:25<Laevos> Hi Goddess <3
13:33:30<Laevos> How're you?
13:33:41<Kita> doin' alright
13:34:35<Laevos> Yay!
13:34:36<Laevos> Me too
13:34:43<Kita> x3
13:34:44<Laevos> played the new Smash Bros. last night
13:34:54<Laevos> though my body wasn't ready to play it for that long
13:35:02<Kita> ?
13:35:07<Laevos> we played it for like
13:35:09<Laevos> many hours
13:35:13<Laevos> and I got pretty worn out by the end xD
13:35:16<Kita> x3
13:35:17<Kita> It is good
13:35:19<Kita> :3
13:35:20<Laevos> It is good!
13:35:24<Laevos> but lol
13:35:32<Laevos> eight-player smash on Palutena's Temple
13:35:39<Laevos> so fucking ridiculous
13:35:41<Kita> worth it
13:35:51<Laevos> we were doing a 10-minute 4-stock match
13:35:55<Laevos> one person was Lucario
13:36:05<Laevos> they got ahead by one stock and were up at like 190%
13:36:08<Kita> Lucario so OP
13:36:10<Laevos> and spent the rest of the match flying around
13:36:12<Laevos> like
13:36:22<Laevos> extremespeeding from one side of the temple ALL THE WAY TO THE OTHER
13:36:25<Laevos> it was fucking absurd
13:36:39<Laevos> that was not the  most fun round, lol
13:36:42<Laevos> but it was pretty amusing
13:37:22<Laevos> since the balancing part of extremespeed where it eventually just kills Lucario if he uses it is kind of made null by the fact that that stage is SO BIG
13:37:24<Kita> x3
13:37:35<Kita> Yush
13:37:54<Laevos> so yeah Lucario OP xD
13:38:10<Laevos> Wii Fit Trainer is cool
13:38:14<Laevos> but weird @_@
13:38:37<Kita> Zero Suit Samus~
13:38:40<Kita> Ike~
13:38:42<Laevos> Hehehe :3
13:38:44<Kita> Little Mac~
13:39:01<Laevos> Little Mac is neat
13:39:42<Laevos> though people whining about how he's TOO STRONG are ridiculous
13:40:02<Laevos> he can't recover for shit
13:40:11<Laevos> or... do anything in the air pretty much
13:40:19<Laevos> but on the ground he's quite scary, yes
13:40:31<Kita> Yeah
13:40:44<Kita> At the midnight release at the Game Stop Kita goes to...
13:40:57<Kita> Kita played Smash 4 3DS with a bunch of people.
13:41:16<Kita> And she rocked Little Mac.
13:41:23<Kita> And Little Mac IS stupid strong.
13:41:29<Laevos> :3
13:41:31<Kita> But no air game~
13:41:34<Laevos> Yeah QuQ
13:41:39<Kita> And that didn't matter
13:41:47<Kita> BECAUSE B SMASH MOTHER FUCKER
13:41:49<Laevos> Yeah, he's still a gr8 character
13:41:51<Kita> WHAM
13:41:52<Laevos> Hehehehe xD
13:41:54<Kita> TURBO KO
13:41:58<Kita> STAR POWER PUNCH
13:42:02<Kita> RIGHT IN THE DICK
13:42:02<Laevos> it's pretty beautiful
13:44:34<Kita> it is.
13:44:40<Kita> Pulling it off feels amazing.
13:44:47<Kita> Also, his side-B is humourous.
13:44:51<Kita> What is even doing
13:44:58<Kita> Jumping and rolling in the air?
13:45:04<Kita> How does that hurt people?
13:45:05<Kita> X3
13:45:32<Laevos> I dunno xD
13:45:52<Laevos> Standing by the edge and waiting for him to do that is a pretty good way to kill inexperienced Little Mac players though
13:46:19<Kita> x3
13:47:56<Laevos> ~u~
13:48:33 Kita: is not an inexperienced Little Mac player, but she DOES like to use the move to fuck around.
13:48:38 Kita: is also a hardcore taunter.
13:50:19<Laevos> Hehehehe >u>
13:50:22<Laevos> Yeah, it's a fun move
13:50:23<Laevos> WOOP
13:50:25<Laevos> WOOP
13:50:27<Laevos> *fly around*
13:50:41<Kita> ZSS is best recovery.
13:50:55<Kita> She has so much manueverability!
13:50:59<Kita> It's ridiculous.
13:55:28<Laevos> I haven't played as her yet :c
13:55:37<Kita> o.o
13:55:43<Kita> She is fast
13:55:46<Kita> Like...
13:55:54<Kita> Captain Falcon fast.
13:57:16<Laevos> :3
13:57:38<Kita> o.o
13:57:46<Laevos> That's pretty fast
