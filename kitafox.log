22:00:47<Laevos> Kita's tails are much prettier...
22:00:50<Laevos> and softer ;///////;
22:01:04 Laevos: pets at reverently
22:03:17 KitaFox: rubs on her ears.
22:03:30<KitaFox> Worship in apology is inferior to worship out of love.

01:04:53<Laevos> Okay, so
01:05:29<Laevos> price was brought down by $200 by switching to AMD
01:05:38<KitaFox> :D
01:05:42<Laevos> with accompanying motherboard
01:05:48<Laevos> from the delicious macrocenter
01:05:57<KitaFox> n.n
01:06:14<Laevos> switching over that soundcard
01:06:56<KitaFox> Know what you can do with 200 dollars?
01:07:24<Laevos> dunno
01:07:37<Laevos> it'll probably be split up such that I won't be able to tell xD
01:07:49<KitaFox> Well
01:08:04<KitaFox> You can buy a 3DS and Pokemon X with 200 dollars.
01:08:05<KitaFox> ;.;
01:08:21<Laevos> Yeah
01:08:32<Laevos> but I can't buy the time to be able to play Pokemon XXX with 200 dollars ;-;
01:09:54 KitaFox: sparkles at
01:10:34 Laevos: is blinded by her brilliance
01:10:35<Laevos> @_@
01:11:37 KitaFox: fixes her eyes.
01:11:56<Laevos> Thank you, Goddess ;u;
01:12:30 KitaFox: is waiting for cybernetic enhancements and gynodroids to become actual things.
01:13:36<Laevos> ouo
01:14:30<KitaFox> Download Laevos into a girlbotbody and keep her for forever.
01:14:34<KitaFox> X3
01:15:08<Laevos> Forever and ever xux
01:15:15<Laevos> but then I'd be a god damn robot
01:15:53<KitaFox> Nah. You'd be you. Once AI became advanced enough, you could function as you did before.
01:16:01<KitaFox> And you'd be a GIRLBOT.
01:16:03<KitaFox> :3
01:16:32 KitaFox: is talking legit gynodroid. A robot built to emulate a human female specimen.
01:16:48<Laevos> As you wish, Goddess xwx
01:16:51<KitaFox> Skin, sense of touch, hair, emotions...
01:17:16<KitaFox> You'd not really be able to tell the difference, aside from the lack of bodily functions.
01:17:41<KitaFox> You wouldn't need to eat, sleep, or expel waste.
01:18:20<Laevos> I dunno how I'd fare without sleep
01:18:31<KitaFox> You could if you wanted.
01:18:37<KitaFox> You just would no longer have to.
01:18:50<Laevos> but could I thoughhhh?
01:19:01<KitaFox> You could.
01:19:31<Laevos> hmm
01:19:36<Laevos> how much would it cost to robotify me?
01:20:01<KitaFox> as much as you don't like Halo... Cortana was an AI made from a brain scan of Dr. Halsey, the SPARTAN program director. Cortana could "sleep" and even "dream", according to in-universe information.
01:20:23<KitaFox> It would probably cost quite a bit.
01:20:42<KitaFox> And we couldn't do it for years and years.
01:20:44<Laevos> More than THIS? http://www.klipsch.com/palladium-p-39f-home-theater-system/details
01:22:09<KitaFox> Once the technology is commercially available, probably not more than that.
01:22:17<Laevos> hmmmm

01:27:57<KitaFox> You could be female, and be whatever kind of pretty you wanted to be.
01:28:30<Laevos> true ;=;
01:28:35<Laevos> but I'd also be a robot
01:28:41<Laevos> and maybe it wouldn't feel any different
01:28:43<Laevos> but I'd know :c
01:29:07<KitaFox> What if Kita said that the idea of a gynodroid turns her on?
01:29:13<Laevos> :c
01:29:42<KitaFox> Would being a robot really be so bad?
01:31:13<Laevos> maybe I'm just... I don't know
01:31:27<Laevos> I've argued for so long that I'm not a computer
01:31:39<Laevos> I don't identify as having a computer for a brain...
01:32:51<KitaFox> It isn't the same as a computer, only comparable.
01:33:23<KitaFox> Computers and brains are similar. Nerves sending pulses... Switches getting flipped...
01:35:37<KitaFox> Doesn't make you and how you feel any less real.
01:35:43<KitaFox> Just makes it more concrete.
01:36:39<KitaFox> Know what is really cool?
01:36:45<Laevos> what is?
01:36:58<KitaFox> We can perfectly emulate a cat's brain at 1/8 speed.
01:37:32<KitaFox> Cat brains are pretty complex!
01:37:40<Laevos> Yay :3
01:38:17<KitaFox> The computer could memorise patterns, like being pet after meowing.
01:38:23<KitaFox> And would meow to be pet.
01:38:40<Laevos> :'3
01:39:12<KitaFox> It could also be traumatised, and responded to abuse. Those experiments did not last long, because they actually seemed to work. o.o;;;
01:42:38<Laevos> Oh @_@
01:42:46<Laevos> source plz?
01:42:50<Laevos> I wanna see O_O
01:43:11<KitaFox> Try googling cat brain emulation 1/8 speed
01:43:20 KitaFox: does not have an article on hand.
01:44:15<Laevos> Think I found it
01:45:52 KitaFox: remembers someone she knew doing a dissertation on AI ethics, as part of her psychology Masters...
01:46:17<Laevos> maybe it'd be nice
01:47:09<KitaFox> You know all those things you don't like about yourself?
01:47:37<Laevos> I suppose
01:47:53<KitaFox> You could, by yourself, shut them off.
01:47:57<Laevos> I could be a body that Kita would find attractive
01:48:09<Laevos> a feat Lilith is unlikely to accomplish otherwise
01:49:25 KitaFox: kisses
01:49:39 Laevos: kisses back <3
01:50:21<KitaFox> You would be, effectively, immortal.
01:50:34<KitaFox> You would never have to worry about missing out on the future.
01:50:58<Laevos> x__________x
01:51:02<Laevos> dunno how I feel about that one
01:51:06<KitaFox> Or
01:51:17<KitaFox> You could just turn yourself off.
01:51:35<Laevos> yeah but people could presumably turn me back on
01:51:51<KitaFox> If Kita let them.
01:52:19<Laevos> what would my AI form look like, Goddess?
01:52:31<KitaFox> Hm?
01:52:37<KitaFox> That would be up to Laevos.
01:52:38<KitaFox> <3
01:52:49<Laevos> what would please Kita?
01:52:54<Laevos> the most
01:53:17<KitaFox> A chubby kitty girl~
01:53:19<KitaFox> <3
01:53:30<Laevos> <3
01:56:44<KitaFox> Would you mind being chubby?
01:56:56<Laevos> it'd be... different

02:13:25<KitaFox> Tell Kita about her eyes~
02:16:10<Laevos> Spheres that cast Her divine gaze upon those worthy to see into the depths of her being, those undulating orbs...

16:07:58<KitaFox> New Demo track released for DragonForce, today... 9 hours ago.
16:08:17<KitaFox> People are praising the "producers" for finally doing something right with the sound mixing.
16:08:44<KitaFox> The funny part? DragonForce are their own producers. Until it is being distributed, they don't let anyone else touch it.
16:09:03<Laevos> that's nice
16:09:04<Laevos> I GUESS
16:09:16<KitaFox> Well
16:09:18<KitaFox> It is silly
16:09:25<Laevos> yeah
16:09:33<Laevos> but so are Dragonforce, so...
16:09:35<KitaFox> Because they blame a non-existant entity for all the failure or success that supposedly see.
16:09:45<KitaFox> DragonForce IS silly and cheesy.
16:09:49<KitaFox> That makes them fun.
16:09:55<KitaFox> Like Rocky Horror Picture Show.
16:09:55<Laevos> they also used to be a white power band
16:10:08<KitaFox> Which is why ZP got the boot.
16:10:10<Laevos> a white power black metal band, even
16:10:17<KitaFox> Also
16:10:22<Laevos> when they were called Demoniac
16:10:35<KitaFox> With an Asian guitarist.
16:10:38 KitaFox: snickers.
16:10:48<Laevos> There are a lot more asian NS bands than one might imagine
16:11:02<KitaFox> But yeah. That was ZP's fault, and he isn't around anymore.
16:11:04<Laevos> lots of Nazi imagery in places like Indonesia, Bangledesh
16:11:24<Laevos> Herman Li was also in the NS black metal band
16:11:25<Laevos> btw
16:11:31<KitaFox> Yes.
16:11:48<KitaFox> But Vadim, Dave, Marc, Sam, and Frederic were not.
16:12:02<Laevos> Sam was, yeah...
16:12:07<Laevos> in fact...
16:12:11 KitaFox: counts back.
16:12:15<KitaFox> Oh yeah, he was.
16:12:25<Laevos> ZP was not...
16:12:32<Laevos> so saying that it's 'his fault' is... uh...
16:12:32<KitaFox> ZP was in Demoniac.
16:12:34<Laevos> nonsensical
16:12:39<Laevos> no, he really wasn't :D
16:12:50<KitaFox> ;\

16:12:57<Laevos> http://www.metal-archives.com/artists/ZP_Theart/2410 *
16:13:06<Laevos> http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Demoniac/2097
16:16:22<KitaFox> You called them Neo-Satanic, yeah?
16:16:28<Laevos> no I didn't
16:16:32<KitaFox> NS
16:16:37<Laevos> NS - national socialist  ;P
16:16:39<KitaFox> What did you mean by that?
16:16:55<KitaFox> National Socialist =! Nazis.
16:16:58<Laevos> i.e., racist themes
16:17:02<Laevos> that's what that genre is called
16:17:03<Laevos> NS black metal
16:17:09<Laevos> even by the people who make it
16:17:20<Laevos> even if it's not specifically related to WWII-era German Naziism
16:17:28<KitaFox> What a weird way of putting it.
16:17:30<KitaFox> Though
16:17:54<KitaFox> From Kita's experience, Satanic themes typically mean hedonists, not racist.
16:18:01<Laevos> well, it's not the satanism
16:18:03<Laevos> it's titles like
16:18:05<Laevos> hold on, let me find it
16:18:20<Laevos> "Celtic Sword of Iron"
16:18:24<Laevos> that sets off /hueg/ alarm bells
16:18:37<KitaFox> Celtic Sword of Iron?
16:18:40<KitaFox> Not seeing it.
16:19:07<Laevos> That kind of vague celtic/pagan mythology reference is what's generally lumped in with bands of sketchy political disposition
16:19:12<KitaFox> Keep in mind, Kita is a relatively sheltered girl from the atrocities of racism and discrimination, beyond her own experiences with being lesbian.
16:19:16<Laevos> it's okay
16:19:21<Laevos> but like
16:19:37<Laevos> that kind of thing is what you see mostly from bands that go around with things like "cleanse mouther Europa"
16:19:43<Laevos> and various other dumbass viewpoints
16:19:59<Laevos> and it's not exactly something that's unknown within the scene
16:20:14<Laevos> like, a band playing black metal in the mid-to-late '90s would certainly be aware of its connotations
16:20:26<Laevos> "Hatred Is Purity"
16:20:28<KitaFox> Celtic imagery kind of lines up with the swords, dragons, knights, and ninjas shtick they do in DragonForce.
16:20:32<Laevos> the not so subtle "Niggerslut"
16:20:45<Laevos> off of "Stormblade"
16:21:32 KitaFox: also never listened to Demoniac, so can't tell if you're naming bands or songs or what.
16:21:34<Laevos> Ehh, you have to be wary (if you care about the political bent of a band) when a black metal band does things with paganism like that, it's very closely intertwined with nationalism and the like
16:21:36<Laevos> oh
16:21:41<Laevos> those are Demoniac songs
16:21:46<Laevos> Stormblade being their album
16:21:58<Laevos> anyway
16:22:11<Laevos> I don't think that the members of Dragonforce are secretly super-racist or anything
16:22:30<Laevos> on the contrary, I think they took on this vague crypto-fascist bent to fit in to an image
16:22:33<KitaFox> Their music now certainly doesn't imply it.
16:22:51<Laevos> which doesn't show them as possessing a whole lot of artistic integrity
16:23:13<Laevos> Demoniac seems to be the height of dumb trend-jumping, tbh
16:23:35<KitaFox> ZP remains questionable, though.
16:23:42<Laevos> I don't know anything about him
16:23:45<KitaFox> His departure from the band was never really publicised.
16:23:59<Laevos> other than he wasn't in this band so any of those allegations are up for people who actually care about Dragonforce to speculate about
16:24:00<KitaFox> And his new band sounds like egotistical penis pumping.
16:24:13<KitaFox> (He named the band iAMi)
16:24:19<Laevos> lol
16:24:23<Laevos> sounds like a h00t
16:24:26<KitaFox> Or I Am I, or IamI, or something like that.
16:24:57<Laevos> 666IamI666
16:25:03<KitaFox> It also feels like they put the Pirates of the Carribean musical score in front of a bad In Flames cover without the screaming.
16:25:14<Laevos> hahahaha
16:25:18<Laevos> that sounds like the height of...
16:25:21<Laevos> abject terribleness
16:25:35<KitaFox> It kind of is.
16:26:01<KitaFox> A lot of speculation surrounds ZP, because of his departure from DragonForce.
16:26:32<KitaFox> Some people think he is some kind of awful Neo-Nazi, or a hardcore drug addict, or a violent, controlling drunkard.
16:26:36<Laevos> Who knows
16:26:52<Laevos> Oh, another lovely song name from what would later be Dragonforce "Kill All the Faggots (Death Squad Anthem)"

17:55:09<Laevos> back!
17:55:46 KitaFox: nibbles on
17:55:57 Laevos: nibbles on a lemon
17:56:16<KitaFox> X3
17:57:02<Laevos> By which she means takes out its insides and consumes them xux
17:57:10<KitaFox> X3
17:57:14<KitaFox> Silly kitty
17:57:19<KitaFox> Lemons are delectable.
17:57:30<KitaFox> So full of powerful flavour.
17:57:32<KitaFox> ;.;
17:57:46<KitaFox> That's what Kita really loves...
17:57:52<KitaFox> The sensation of taste.
17:58:40<Laevos> Mmmmmm <3
17:59:27<KitaFox> DragonForce does have this... They are one of VERY few Power Metal bands to have an audible bass solo.
17:59:33<KitaFox> And Kita loves audible bass.
17:59:52<KitaFox> Powerful, thumping bass guitar.
17:59:53<KitaFox> <3
18:00:25<KitaFox> Twangy bass is even better when it isn't surrounded by awful country drivel.
18:00:43<Laevos> http://www.metal-archives.com/board/viewforum.php?f=11&sid=9059be95b0e7ae59eb9836f4dda45f3f "What are power metal bands with audible bass solos?"
18:01:04<Laevos> Well, it'd probably something for the Heavy/Power/Speed help thread
18:01:32<Laevos> which has quite the extensive breadth from what I hear
18:03:03<KitaFox> Well
18:03:15<KitaFox> Heavy, Power, and Speed are all different.
18:03:21<Laevos> Yes, Kita
18:03:22<Laevos> I'm well aware
18:03:42<Laevos> It's just overlapping taste that made it more efficient for a single thread to cover all three
18:03:56<KitaFox> Power and Speed less so than Heavy, with the main difference between them being the use of a synthesizer to amplify and deaden certain sounds.
18:03:56<KitaFox> (In Power, not Speed.)
18:03:56<KitaFox> ;.;
18:04:06<KitaFox> But that difference makes a LOT of difference.
18:04:19<Laevos> just go ask for help so that you can educate yourself :c
18:04:43<Laevos> It pains me when such a bright little foxiegoddess such as yourself toutes the same band as gross fourteen-year-old-boys the world over! ;~;
18:05:10<KitaFox> Actually, it is the gross fourteen-year-old boys that hate on DragonForce.
18:05:11<KitaFox> :P
18:05:18<KitaFox> (From Kita's experience.)
18:05:28<Laevos> Kita's already admitted that she's quite isolated!
18:05:38<KitaFox> Nowadays.
18:06:20<Laevos> Anyway
18:06:37<KitaFox> The Heavy/Power/Speed thread seems to be the most popular.
18:06:46<Laevos> there's always #metal, too, the official IRC of the site if you ever want to talk about such thingies
18:06:59<KitaFox> eh...
18:06:59<Laevos> since I'm not too knowledgable on (sub)genres that I don't really listen to
18:07:36<KitaFox> Kita is not a fan of most metal fans... She knows this from her time on /r/metal.
18:08:05<Laevos> That just shows that you're not a fan of Reddit metal fans
18:08:09<Laevos> don't worry, I'm sure I'm not, either!
18:08:22<Laevos> anyway
18:08:28<Laevos> metal is somewhat rarely talked about in #metal
18:08:34<KitaFox> They bicker and squabble over pointless things. It isn't even genres (which it used to be)... Now it is over how a guitarist holds their guitar.
18:08:44<Laevos> That kind of discussion has never come up in #metal
18:08:49<Laevos> and if it did I'd kick the participants!
18:08:54<KitaFox> o.O
18:09:00<Laevos> With divine fury!
18:09:02<KitaFox> You're a mod?
18:09:10<Laevos> A channel operator
18:09:17<KitaFox> Ah.
18:09:20<Laevos> not a mod on the site (as I'm not that active on the forum)
18:09:27<KitaFox> Yup. /whois confirms!
18:10:16<Laevos> I do have somewhat elevated editing ability on the main site because of my contributions to the database
18:10:27<Laevos> but not moderator-level, just enough to help with more reports
18:10:29<Laevos> when I have time... @_@
18:10:43<KitaFox> Also
18:10:55<KitaFox> Power Metal is note the most... varied genre.
18:10:58<KitaFox> not*
18:11:03<Laevos> I dunno Kita
18:11:08<Laevos> how many power metal bands have YOU listened to?
18:11:25<Laevos> there are at least six-thousand!
18:11:59<Laevos> The biggest distinction I know of is between European power metal and USPM (from the United States)
18:12:09<KitaFox> If Kita didn't think they stood out, would she remember their names...?
18:12:17<Laevos> In other words
18:12:18<Laevos> LIKE FOUR?
18:12:19<Laevos> ;o
18:12:43<Laevos> That's more or less how many power metal bands I listen to
18:12:44<Laevos> tbh
18:12:47<Laevos> let's see...
18:13:01<Laevos> Demons & Wizards, Gamma World, Vicious Rumors... maybe it's only three!
18:13:22<KitaFox> More like "used to listen to a power metal-centric internet radio station, but not a lot ever stood out that Kita remembered, so she never pursued."
18:13:31<Laevos> What, Pandora?
18:13:39<KitaFox> Nah.
18:13:59<Laevos> death.fm? ;P
18:14:40<KitaFox> A friend, who was a die-hard Power Metal fanatic used to just leave up a playlist, and people would listen to it.
18:14:44<KitaFox> Kita doesn't remember.
18:14:49<KitaFox> This was a few years ago.
18:14:59<Laevos> Well okay then
18:15:14<Laevos> Well I'm just Saiyan
18:15:16<KitaFox> It was... weeks worth of music.
18:15:22<KitaFox> Weeks and weeks.
18:15:28<Laevos> You could probably do better-off than gat-dang Dragonforce :c
18:15:39<Laevos> I mean you ceartainly could, that's a verifiable fact!
18:15:49<KitaFox> Kita listens to Edguy and Rhapsody of Fire, sometimes!
18:16:10<KitaFox> But only older Edguy, because the newer stuff is just out of her tastes.
18:16:21<Laevos> Yeah I heard some newer Edguy once
18:16:23<Laevos> it was awful
18:16:24<KitaFox> Still good, just not what Kita wants out of the band.
18:16:30<Laevos> some toughguy hard rock BS :c
18:16:42<Laevos> their older stuff is supposedly
18:16:43<Laevos> more reputable
18:16:46<KitaFox> It is more akin to 80s hair metal, just reimagined.
18:16:54<Laevos> Yeah, that's what I said ;P
18:17:11<KitaFox> 80s hair metal isn't "toughguy hard rock"
18:17:20<Laevos> Nah, it's ballady hard rock!
18:17:24<Laevos> But ~reimagined~ ;3
18:17:27<KitaFox> Most hair metal musicians looked like women.
18:17:30<KitaFox> XP
18:17:35<Laevos> Anyway
18:18:08<Laevos> want some lemon? ;3
18:18:56 KitaFox: offers to trade a lime for a lemon
18:19:05<KitaFox> Also
18:19:12<KitaFox> Forum with no anonymous posting
18:19:13<KitaFox> ;.;
18:19:20<KitaFox> Or at least..
18:19:28<KitaFox> It would rather Kita make an account.
18:19:35<Laevos> No anonymous posting
18:19:43<KitaFox> Blech.
18:19:45<Laevos> I dunno, that can only be seen as a good thing to me Dx
18:19:49<Laevos> I hate anonymous posting capabilities
18:20:00<KitaFox> Just want to ask one question.
18:20:10<KitaFox> Don't think she'll become an active participant.
18:20:14<Laevos> You can make an account for that!
18:20:16<Laevos> Plenty of people do :P
18:20:17<KitaFox> Just another dead, abandoned account.
18:20:32<KitaFox> Clogging up the user database, of dead, abandoned accounts.
18:20:37<Laevos> Oh whateva xD
18:20:50<Laevos> You could always ask in the channel, you may or may not recieve a response
18:21:02<Laevos> lurking around for a while is generally preferable to the people that just
18:21:10<Laevos> pop in, ask a question
18:23:26<KitaFox> Also
18:23:28<KitaFox> Forums
18:23:32<KitaFox> Are just so...
18:23:35<KitaFox> Formal feeling.
18:23:55<Laevos> fourmal ;o
18:24:01<Laevos> anyway
18:24:06<Laevos> you're under no imperative to ask about it!
18:24:17<Laevos> You don't have to make excuses to me if you don't want to ;o
18:24:24<Laevos> just thought I'd share the resource with you :c
18:24:40<KitaFox> It's more...
18:25:09<KitaFox> Kita just doesn't like getting a quality resource, and not using it, because it is inconvenient to use.
18:25:09<KitaFox> >>
18:25:55<Laevos> well like I said
18:25:58<Laevos> you're always welcome in the channel
18:26:06<Laevos> to either observe or ask the question straightaway
18:26:07<KitaFox> "Wow, this is EXACTLY where Kita would ask this question! Oh... Really? I have to make and verify ANOTHER account? Just to ask this ultimately pointless question?... Ugh..."
18:26:19<Laevos> xD
18:26:33<KitaFox> Another database with her e-mail stored in it...
18:26:40<Laevos> Can always use a dummy account
18:26:41<Laevos> anyway
18:26:45<KitaFox> Another tag for a fucking ad company to flood her inbox with.
18:26:47<Laevos> I know the proprietors of the site
18:26:51 KitaFox: chews on her e-mail.
18:26:57<Laevos> they won't give your e-mail to any third parties
18:27:17<KitaFox> Doesn't mean the third parties won't take it, anyway.
18:27:26<KitaFox> Because that happens!
18:27:32<Laevos> Let's see
18:27:38<Laevos> I think there's an option to make your e-maial not public
18:28:22<Laevos> There has been exactly one case in my memory where forum users got spam e-mail from some entity that collected e-mail addresses from the site, and that was investigated and dealt with, I believe

00:14:34Kita is now known as KitaFox
00:14:34<KitaFox> Ugh... This whole Brandon Eich debacle is upsetting and irritating.
00:14:45<Laevos> Who...?
00:15:08<KitaFox> New CEO of the Mozilla Corporation, who, years ago, donated 1000 USD to Prop 8.
00:16:17<KitaFox> Before he was with the Mozilla Corp, and since he has been with the Mozilla Corp, he has made NO movements, and states he plans on making no movements, towards the exclusion of the LGBT community.
00:16:22<Laevos> Oh, okay
00:17:22<KitaFox> He has, openly and plainly, stated that he is sorry for contributing to a situation that has caused so much pain, and that for the now, he is focusing on actions, rather than words, to show people that he is for the people now, and not for himself.
00:17:26<KitaFox> Which...
00:17:40<KitaFox> Is yet to be seen, but the words are nice.
00:17:59<Laevos> Yeah, I suppose so...
00:18:01 Laevos: hug
00:18:04 Laevos: huggles*
00:18:46<KitaFox> But people are screaming "BOYCOTT FIREFOX", despite the fact that FireFox is produced by the Mozilla Foundation, the non-profit that all of the Mozilla Corporation's profits are sunk into.
00:18:54<Laevos> omg x__x
00:19:03<Laevos> Some people are really silly, yeah
00:19:31<KitaFox> Which means Mozilla Corp has NO profits to sink into anti-gay stuff, because it all goes to the, pro-LGBT, Mozilla Foundation.
00:19:47<KitaFox> They chose Brandon Eich because he was the father of Java.
00:20:10<KitaFox> You know... That thing that the entirety of internet media practically runs on?
00:20:15<Laevos> for now...
00:20:31<Laevos> but yeah
00:20:37 Laevos: licks
00:20:43<Laevos> Don't worry Kita
00:20:48<Laevos> I won't use Firefox any less than I already do
00:21:01<Laevos> Unfortunately that's practically never since I use Chrome, but still
00:21:24 KitaFox: uses FireFox because it isn't fished for data by the NSA, and it is completely customisable.
00:21:38<KitaFox> Kita likes privacy.
00:21:49<KitaFox> The internet used to be where she could have some.
00:21:51<KitaFox> ;.;
00:21:53<Laevos> I get off sexually on knowing that the NSA has access to my internet browsing
00:21:59<Laevos> but your outlook is understandable too
00:22:36<KitaFox> Kita likes having special knowledge of things that no one else has to know.
00:22:43<Laevos> :3
00:22:53<KitaFox> And sometimes? Kita has special knowledge that she wants to share...
00:22:58<KitaFox> But not with a stranger!
00:23:00<Laevos> o:
00:23:02<Laevos> Stranger danger!
00:23:11<KitaFox> Kita should get to pick and choose who she wants to share with.
00:23:19<Laevos> Sometimes when I'm with my partner on Skype without clothes and stuff
00:23:21<Laevos> I think to myself
00:23:31<Laevos> "I hope somebody at the NSA is at least masturbating to this"
00:23:36<Laevos> and I really do
00:23:45<Laevos> I'd hate for them to take no pleasure in having to screen through all of that :c
00:23:57<KitaFox> It should be 100% exclusive of the people Kita doesn't want to know, and 100% inclusive of the people Kita wants to know.
00:24:03<Laevos> that's fine
00:24:07<Laevos> u go girl
00:24:09<Laevos> etc.
00:24:14<KitaFox> Kita thinks it is REASONABLE
00:24:22<Laevos> YOU'RE REASONABLE
00:24:23<Laevos> wait yes
00:25:06<KitaFox> Also...Kita is uncomfortable with men knowing about her fetish
00:25:07<KitaFox> :<
00:25:16<Laevos> that's understandable :c
00:25:40<Laevos> Question though
00:25:47<Laevos> is Chromium not Chrome without the tracking stuff?
00:25:48<KitaFox> You're a girl, to Kita.
00:25:52<KitaFox> Uh...
00:25:55 KitaFox: shrugs?
00:26:11 Laevos: doesn't use Chromium, but remembered hearing that's what it was
00:26:12<KitaFox> Kita uses FireFox for its customisability, first and foremost.
00:26:17<Laevos> Yeah
00:26:24<Laevos> that's fine too
00:26:43<KitaFox> Chrome is not very customisable. It doesn't have to be, but Kita prefers customisation.
00:26:51 KitaFox: uses mIRC for this reason, as well.
00:26:57<Laevos> The only extension for Chrome that I have is adblock plus, haha
00:27:47 KitaFox: has window transparency for FireFox, despite no other Windows application having it, so she can do web browsing stuff while watching movies.
00:27:54<KitaFox> One thing Kita misses about Linux...
00:27:58<KitaFox> Window Transparency.
00:28:02<Laevos> Huh
00:28:05<KitaFox> It was so useful.
00:28:07<KitaFox> ;.;
00:28:09<Laevos> čnč
00:28:10<Laevos> err
00:28:11<Laevos> ;n;*
00:28:16<KitaFox> Movies + IRC.
00:28:26<Laevos> Yeah
00:28:27<KitaFox> At the same time.
00:28:37<Laevos> omg gurl ur livin in the future
00:28:37<KitaFox> Both full screen!
00:28:39<KitaFox> Also
00:28:48<Laevos> I'd prefer to use two screens for that
00:28:50<KitaFox> Windows eats up SO much processing power.
00:28:56<Laevos> even if window transparency were an option
00:28:57<Laevos> since
00:29:08<Laevos> it'd annoy the hell out of me even to have it transparently visible over the movie screen at all
00:29:15<KitaFox> :P
00:29:24<KitaFox> Don't knock it 'til you try it.
00:29:27<Laevos> but that's just me
00:29:37<KitaFox> Also, kUbuntu is the easiest Linux distro to learn...
00:29:48<KitaFox> Ran it one several netbooks and notebooks.
00:30:07<KitaFox> Super low power consumption.
00:30:23<Laevos> Yay
00:30:30<Laevos> I use Debian
00:30:35<KitaFox> A netbook, doing things through WINE. Who would have thought?!
00:30:44<KitaFox> Debian is good.
00:30:46<KitaFox> kUbuntu was just easy.
00:30:48<Laevos> yeah
00:30:59<Laevos> plus Debian seemed good for server
00:31:02<Laevos> sans GUI
00:31:02<KitaFox> KDE is a good GUI and software suite.
00:31:26<KitaFox> And kUbuntu is just Ubuntu + KDE.
00:31:47<KitaFox> Oh. And even better?
00:31:48<Laevos> Yeah well Fallout is just Oblivion with guns
00:31:51<Laevos> but go on
00:32:14 KitaFox: doesn't like Fallout, and Oblivion was better than Skyrim, but not as good as Morrowind.
00:32:24<Laevos> I've played
00:32:26<Laevos> zero of those games
00:32:36<KitaFox> Amarok, the media player that came with it...
00:32:40<Laevos> I'm just parroting a turn of phrase my friends used to use, sorry
00:32:47<Laevos> Best media player EVER?
00:32:49<KitaFox> Comes with an auto-iPod cracker.
00:32:59<Laevos> That's neat
00:33:15<KitaFox> (Works on any media player, but iPod is more impressive to have an auto-cracker for.)
00:33:23<KitaFox> Yeah.
00:33:33<Laevos> Does it work for iPods that aren't compatible with, say, Rockbox?
00:33:37<Laevos> Or maybe I should ask
00:33:41<Laevos> what is it 'cracking' into it?
00:34:00<Laevos> Like, I don't think some of the newer models of iPod have been 'cracked' at all
00:34:02<Laevos> as far as I know
00:34:28<KitaFox> Turns it into the equivalent of a USB mp3 player, but keeps all the things that makes an iPod better than a USB mp3 player.
00:34:45<KitaFox> So you can drag and drop music, without worrying about DRM.
00:35:09<KitaFox> And it works on iPods, but not iTouchs, iPads, or iPhones.
00:35:12<Laevos> Okay
00:35:19<Laevos> so it's pretty much the same as Winamp in that regard, then
00:35:26<KitaFox> Kind of.
00:35:31<Laevos> since you can plug an iPod in and Winamp can interface with it
00:35:35<Laevos> drag-and-drop and all
00:35:50<KitaFox> It just asks if you want to do it, first... Because it is polite.
00:36:04<Laevos> eoe
00:36:09<Laevos> well neat-O
00:36:18<Laevos> I guess Winamp also asks when it says
00:36:26<Laevos> "Is [such and such] a device that you want to manage with Winamp"
00:36:27<Laevos> or w/e
00:36:31<KitaFox> Amarok has an auto search function that uses the web to find lyrics and song info, too.
00:36:45<Laevos> Those kinds of things are generally not useful for me
00:36:50<Laevos> Gracenote database and the like
00:36:51 KitaFox: shrugs.
00:36:57<KitaFox> They are interesting features.
00:36:58<Laevos> since more often than not I have to submit the data myself
00:37:00<Laevos> which I do!
00:37:07<Laevos> to hopefully make it more useful for others in the future.
00:37:10<KitaFox> :3
00:37:34<KitaFox> Amarok allows you to add your own lyrics file to the song data...
00:37:52<Laevos> Future owners of Alwaar's Триумф чёрной меланхолии will surely thank me >u>
00:37:55<KitaFox> So when it pulls it up, it can pull up the lyrics in the format you like and you typed it.
00:37:57<Laevos> Hmm, in the ID3 tags or what?
00:37:58<KitaFox> XP
00:38:02<KitaFox> Unsure.
00:38:11<Laevos> For all filetypes?
00:38:20<KitaFox> Works on more filetypes than VLC.
00:38:20<Laevos> If that includes WAVs then it's probably not writing it to the file itself
00:38:40<KitaFox> Could just be Amarok's own metadata.
00:38:48<Laevos> since WAV doesn't support any tags besides the BEXT chunk
00:38:52<Laevos> probably, yeah
00:39:12<KitaFox> But it is also super easy to use, really intuitive, and really pretty.
00:39:16<KitaFox> Also, customisable.
00:39:17<Laevos> Yeah c:
00:39:22<Laevos> I've heard good things about Amarok
00:39:25 KitaFox: murrs.
00:39:25<Laevos> never used it though
00:39:37<Laevos> I'll customise you >u>
00:39:40 Laevos: puts a bow on
00:39:42 KitaFox: misses Amarok... but when she Linux'd, she missed playing games.
00:40:02<Laevos> Aww :P
00:40:05<KitaFox> The whole KDE suite is actually really lovely.
00:40:15<KitaFox> Utility, with style.
00:40:21<Laevos> Could one say that it's really... sweet? ;3
00:40:27<KitaFox> XP
00:40:38<Laevos> I hope you appreciate my puns
00:40:44<Laevos> they're only for you, Goddess~ <3
00:41:05<KitaFox> There was only one piece of software that Kita got frustrated with, and that was the widget managing software.
00:41:07<KitaFox> So...
00:41:16<KitaFox> Kita got rid of it, and didn't use widgets.
00:41:17<KitaFox> :3
00:41:27<Laevos> Widgets
00:41:30<Laevos> what a weird word
00:41:41<KitaFox> Which is the best solution, really.
00:42:25<Laevos> :3
00:42:34<Laevos> My sister wants a DRM-V for her birthday
00:42:43<KitaFox> DRM-V?
00:43:05<Laevos> err
00:43:06<Laevos> DSM*
00:43:51<Laevos> Hahaha, DRM x_x
00:43:56<Laevos> But no, this: http://www.appi.org/SearchCenter/Pages/SearchDetail.aspx?ItemId=2554
00:45:56<KitaFox> o.o
00:46:02<KitaFox> She likes psychology?
00:46:11<Laevos> well, she's studying music therapy
00:46:24<Laevos> so... kinda comes with the territory?
00:46:54<KitaFox> Ah.
00:47:17<Laevos> and she seems genuinely interested in that kind of thing
00:47:29<KitaFox> Music therapy is, unfortunately, so infantile in its development... it'll be years before we see real breakthroughs in it...
00:47:47<Laevos> Oh well
00:47:54<Laevos> All the more reason to go into it!
00:48:07<Laevos> Though I think she's more interested in practice than research
00:48:12<Laevos> at least that's what she said
00:49:13<KitaFox> Practice is currently ineffective, due to overpractice, and lack of research.
00:49:19<KitaFox> Which is sad.
00:49:28<KitaFox> because it has promise and potential.
00:50:00<KitaFox> Hopefully, through her studies, she realises this and goes into research, but if she goes into practice, well... Good luck to her.
00:50:13<KitaFox> She will certainly need a little bit of coincidence on her side.
00:50:16<KitaFox> o.o
00:50:21<Laevos> whatever :3
00:50:25<KitaFox> (Says the certifiably insane person.)
00:50:56<Laevos> I dunno, saying that an entire field of practice is 'currently ineffective' seems like a fairly grandiose oversimplification, no?
00:51:22<Laevos> Anyway
00:51:27<Laevos> she doesn't strike me at all as the research type
00:51:52<KitaFox> It is currently ineffective because we aren't quite sure how to make it effective.
00:52:14<KitaFox> A flashlight would be ineffective without a power button. A method of controlled outcome.
00:52:22<KitaFox> It will be found eventually.
00:52:32<Laevos> I think there's a key difference in 'practices which are not currently codified and understood' and 'has no current actualization'
00:53:00<Laevos> no perceptable effect, that is
00:53:08<KitaFox> There is.
00:53:12<Laevos> err, percievable
00:53:17<Laevos> *eiv
00:53:21<KitaFox> But both could be defined by "ineffective"
00:53:31<Laevos> Yeah, in broad strokes...
00:53:36<Laevos> but they signify two quite different realities
00:54:19<KitaFox> truth
00:54:35 KitaFox: licks.
00:54:42 Laevos: wiggles
00:54:54<Laevos> yeah, she and I often have to face the brunt of very annoying questions at family gatherings
00:54:59<KitaFox> :<
00:55:02<KitaFox> Sad.
00:55:16<Laevos> around people who see education as an investment, the sole outcome of which is a monetary 'return'
00:55:50<KitaFox> Education is viewed as an investment, because time is money in American society.
00:55:52<Laevos> (Lilith, in case she has not stated, plans to continue on to get a Master's in library science)
00:56:06<KitaFox> You could be a librarian.
00:56:07<KitaFox> :3
00:56:14<Laevos> Yeah but
00:56:15<Laevos> I don't want to xD
00:56:20<KitaFox> So then...
00:56:26<Laevos> I mean I'm not ruling it out, but it's not the end goal
00:56:28<KitaFox> What are you going to do?
00:56:34<KitaFox> What is the end goal?
00:56:34<KitaFox> :3
00:56:37<Laevos> I'd rather work in an archive, or something else in informatics altogether
00:56:42<KitaFox> Oooo
00:56:47<KitaFox> Much more interesting.
00:57:01<Laevos> Librarians are amazing, wonderful, sociable people
00:57:07<KitaFox> (Pays better, too, though that isn't really what it is about.)
00:57:19<Laevos> I don't want to work in computer science
00:57:26<Laevos> I'd literally kill myself, that's why I switched out of that track
00:57:45<Laevos> but I'm not going to ignore the obvious advantage that technical knowledge can bring to information and humanities-related fields
00:57:50<KitaFox> Computer science isn't bad... :<
00:57:53<Laevos> I hated it
00:57:56<Laevos> I hated the people
00:57:59<Laevos> hated their outlook on life
00:58:03 KitaFox: tikka takkas at game code...
00:58:03<KitaFox> :<
00:58:04<Laevos> maybe if I'd studied it somewhere else
00:58:10<Laevos> with better people
00:58:14<Laevos> not fucking engineering students...
00:58:30<Laevos> Lilith will never go back to CS at this university
00:58:34<Laevos> maybe somewhere else, but not here
00:58:42<KitaFox> Computer Engineering and Computer Science are really different, but a lot of schools lump them together.
00:58:54<Laevos> Well, CS was part of the greater 'school of engineering'
00:59:01<KitaFox> Ugh. No.
00:59:07<KitaFox> That is not where it needs to be.
00:59:18<Laevos> in fact, the main department it fell under was EECS - Electrical Engineering and Computer Science
00:59:34<KitaFox> It needs to be in a Math department or its own department.
00:59:41<KitaFox> (Computer Science, that is)
00:59:42<Laevos> being in that department made me want to inflict bodily harm on myself every single day, many days of which I acted out that wish
01:00:14<Laevos> so yeah
01:00:17<Laevos> not at KU at least
01:00:33<KitaFox> NC State has a good computer science program.
01:00:38<Laevos> though what really got me was
01:00:41<KitaFox> So does Georgia Tech.
01:00:49<Laevos> the part where it wasn't about making anymore, rather optimizing
01:00:52<Laevos> making things as good as possible
01:01:01<Laevos> not something that my brain or emotional state enjoys
01:01:27<Laevos> Lilith often finds unorthodox (sub-optimal) ways of doing things that suit  her way of thinking more directly
01:01:38 KitaFox: nods
01:01:42<Laevos> these did not prove useful in the context of working directly with computers
01:01:51<KitaFox> It is easier to go as is than it is to change.
01:02:42<Laevos> for a while I had (and probably honestly still have) no idea what I was (/am) doing
01:02:51<KitaFox> X3
01:02:55<Laevos> I switched my major to German, kept applying for jobs and just kind of... floated for a while
01:03:03<KitaFox> That's okay
01:03:09<Laevos> consequences of which include needing to do two more semesters
01:03:18<KitaFox> Most people don't have any idea what they are doing.
01:03:19<Laevos> but also feeling a bit more satisfaction in the direction of my existence
01:03:33<KitaFox> They are just good at bullshitting.
01:03:57<KitaFox> Kita's game code has mostly been guess work, you know.
01:04:03 KitaFox: kisses her cheek.
01:04:03<Laevos> Yeah
01:04:06 Laevos: smoochles xux
01:04:16<Laevos> Lilith still tries to keep a decent understanding of coding
01:04:23<Laevos> C++ being the only language that she really knows to any extent
01:04:51<KitaFox> You should try Python
01:04:57<KitaFox> It is like coding in butter.
01:04:58<KitaFox> <3
01:05:05<Laevos> I've tried Python before
01:05:20<Laevos> and while I've darped around with the directed 1:1 immediate input-output stuff
01:05:25<Laevos> I've never really written anything in it
01:05:38<KitaFox> Programming robots in it
01:06:01<Laevos> I dunno, lots of microcontrollers like C-type languages ;P
01:06:03<Laevos> Kitaaaaaaa
01:06:13<KitaFox> It is more like talking to it, than it is like coding it.
01:06:14<KitaFox> o.o
01:06:22<Laevos> come shower with me and you can tell me all of the sweet secrets of Python robots
01:06:28<KitaFox> X3
01:06:29<Laevos> and I can condition your hair
01:06:31<Laevos> it'll be funnnn
01:06:41<KitaFox> Kita wouldn't fit in Lilith's shower.
01:06:44<Laevos> Perhaps not
01:06:47<Laevos> it's rather cramped as it is
01:06:52<Laevos> but love will find a wayyyyyy
01:06:53<KitaFox> Her ass is too fat
01:07:18<Laevos> Does Kita have an acceptable bathtub/shower situation there?
01:07:25<Laevos> that can accomodate her legendary booty?
01:07:25 KitaFox: nods.
01:07:28<Laevos> Yay!
01:07:42<Laevos> Then you can tell me about Python robots there, someday Cx
01:08:06<KitaFox> Kita doesn't like leaving her house..
01:08:16 Laevos: nodnods
01:08:19<KitaFox> She got her butt stuck in a doorway once...
01:08:21<KitaFox> ;.;
01:08:22<Laevos> Aww...
01:08:30<Laevos> That's awful, I'm sorry, Kita Dx
01:08:50<Laevos> Lilith hopes that one day she can be allowed to visit Kita, but understands that Kita needs lots of time to be comfortable <3
01:08:59 KitaFox: nods...
01:09:22<KitaFox> It was a double door, but it had the bar in the middle, made of metal.
01:09:43<KitaFox> Kita didn't think about it...
01:09:57<Laevos> Mew...
01:09:59<KitaFox> And wedged her hips in between the frame and the center bar...
01:10:03 Laevos: nuzzles against
01:10:13<KitaFox> They laughed at her.
01:10:17<Laevos> ...mew
01:10:36<KitaFox> Kita may have cried
01:11:13<KitaFox> From then on, all bulk groceries are delivered.
01:11:14 Laevos: kisses her beautiful Goddess over and over again... the idol of her worship, the most magnificent, the most pure and wondrous...
01:11:17<KitaFox> :<
01:11:24<Laevos> I am so sorry that you had to go through that...
01:11:52<KitaFox> Also... Public furniture...
01:11:54<KitaFox> ;.;
01:12:01<Laevos> Mew... ;n;
01:12:10 KitaFox: fears for its structural stability...
01:12:43 Laevos: wraps nuzzles at lovingly
01:13:01 KitaFox: once bent a metal bench, and broke a restaurant booth bench.
01:13:20<Laevos> Mew...
01:14:03<Laevos> Love you, Kitagoddess Q_Q
01:14:07 KitaFox: rubs her bttom...
01:14:46<Laevos> Kita...? Thank you for seeing Lilith as a girl... <3

23:10:57<KitaFox> [21:09] <KitaFox> Also
23:10:57<KitaFox> [21:09] <KitaFox> Can
23:10:57<KitaFox> [21:09] <KitaFox> We just appreciate this for a second:
23:10:57<KitaFox> [21:10] <KitaFox> Fox, Slippy, Peppy, Falco, and, later, Krystal... All cut off their own legs, just to fly faster.
23:11:06<Laevos> xD
23:11:08<Laevos> What
23:11:12<KitaFox> Yes.
23:11:34<KitaFox> The entire StarFox team, due to the EXTREME G-forces experienced during combat missions...
23:11:45<KitaFox> Cut off their own legs, and replaced them with cybernetics.
23:12:06<Laevos> Oh, okay
23:12:08<Laevos> ;u;
23:12:38<KitaFox> (G-forces force blood to rush to your feet, and their G-Diffuser system is not enough to eliminate the G-forces experienced in combat missions.)
23:12:50<Laevos> ;-;
23:14:06<KitaFox> Well
23:14:10<KitaFox> It isn't... required...
23:14:25<KitaFox> Just... The ones that do live longer, and are better pilots.
23:14:31<Laevos> Yeah
23:14:33<Laevos> understandabl
23:14:34<Laevos> e
23:14:53<KitaFox> And considering that the StarFox Commandos are a mercenary team?
23:15:05<KitaFox> They need every edge they can get.
23:15:33 Laevos: nods, stretches out
23:15:40<Laevos> Lilith's back hurts x___x
23:15:47<KitaFox> o.o
23:15:49<KitaFox> ?
23:15:52<Laevos> well
23:15:58<Laevos> took a bath last night and went straight to bed
23:16:04<Laevos>  /not a good idea
23:16:14<KitaFox> ...?
23:16:16<Laevos> because
23:16:17<KitaFox> Howso?
23:16:22<Laevos> body gets really relaxed
23:16:28<Laevos> so we fall asleep in weird positions
23:16:32<KitaFox> Oh
23:16:35<Laevos> then when we tense back up, it makes us wake up in pain
23:16:37<Laevos> all the next day
23:18:42<KitaFox> You should invest in some pain meds
23:18:51<KitaFox> Like Acetomenaphin or Ibuprofen
23:18:52<Laevos> not usually in pain
23:18:57<Laevos> hahahaha xD
23:19:00<Laevos> I have some Tylenol downstairs
23:19:01<KitaFox> Yeah well
23:19:05<KitaFox> Use it
23:19:06<KitaFox> ;.;
23:19:09<Laevos> nooooooo
23:19:10<Laevos> it's okay
23:19:50 KitaFox: barks at
23:21:36 Laevos: mewls o_o
23:21:48<KitaFox> Do it
23:21:56<Laevos> it's all the way downstaaaaaaairs ;-;
23:22:08<Laevos> and I'm in bed :c
23:22:12 KitaFox: pins her ears back.
23:22:20 Laevos: looks all stretched-out
23:22:24<KitaFox> No need to be in uneccessary pain
23:23:21<Laevos> It's worth it... to be here with Kita xux
23:23:23<Laevos> and anyway
23:23:25<Laevos> laying down helps
23:23:28<Laevos> toooo
23:23:42<KitaFox> :<
23:25:01<Laevos> Aww...
23:25:09<Laevos> Is Kita going to be very sad if I don't get some Tylenol?
23:25:16<KitaFox> :<
23:25:20 Laevos: SIGHS
23:25:25<KitaFox> :<
23:25:26<Laevos> you know what we call that, Goddess?
23:25:28<Laevos> PEER PRESSURE
23:25:33 Laevos: caves in :P
23:25:38<Laevos> only for you, Goddess
23:25:40<KitaFox> Yes, but this is to make you feel better.
23:26:00<Laevos> Your Priestess does not want her Goddess to be sad
23:26:11<Laevos> so she will go take some pain meds now, brb <3

23:52:52<KitaFox> Seen this book
23:53:42<Laevos> reminds me of the
23:53:45<Laevos> SONIC  YOU ARE EYES
23:53:46<Laevos> thing
23:53:56<KitaFox> XD
23:54:03<Laevos> which I've never been able to find again
23:54:04<KitaFox> Ever read Sonuc and Talse?
23:54:06<Laevos> No
23:54:09<Laevos> Just seen some images
23:54:10<Laevos> I know I want it
23:54:13<Laevos> want it so baaaaaaad
23:54:19<KitaFox> Sonuc and Talse is easily Googleable
23:54:25<Laevos> it is now
23:54:28<Laevos> I never knew the proper title
23:55:59<Laevos> loooooool
23:57:25<KitaFox> XD
23:57:31<Laevos> hodgepodge
23:57:45 KitaFox: isn't quite sure if Sonuc and Talse was the one Lilith was looking for
23:58:44<Laevos> Noooo
23:58:48<Laevos> what I was looking for was a comic
23:59:05<Laevos> but still
23:59:10<Laevos> "and with a flick of the wrist a love was lambasted that angels would surely vociferate in choir to the earth below."

00:22:28 Laevos: smoochles <3333
00:22:34 Laevos: wriggles restlessly
00:24:20 KitaFox: sighs, fiddling with the backstory for her Gym Leader persona
00:25:05<Laevos> Awww
00:25:11<Laevos> Kita would be the coolest Gym Leader ;u;
00:25:55<KitaFox> Kita has lost her type, due to, yet another, competitive nerf.
00:26:52<Laevos> Aww...
00:27:12<Laevos> What was Kita's type?
00:27:20<KitaFox> Psychic
00:29:29<Laevos> :cccc
00:30:02<Laevos> Psychic #1
00:30:14<KitaFox> Okay
00:30:23<KitaFox> Psychic started off as the most powerful type.
00:30:35<KitaFox> All Psychic Pokemon had super high Special stat.
00:30:45<KitaFox> Which was both attack and defense.
00:30:51<KitaFox> (It got split later)
00:31:04<Laevos> Yeah
00:31:50<KitaFox> They had only TWO moves that were Super-Effective against them, and one move that was SUPPOSED to be Super-Effective, but was completely ineffective, because glitch.
00:32:02<KitaFox> (Twin Needle, Pin Missile, and then Lick)
00:32:20<KitaFox> The only Pokemon that could learn Twin Needle?
00:32:44<KitaFox> Beedrill, which was not very strong, only moderately fast, and had stupidly weak Special
00:32:51<Laevos> Take that
00:32:52<Laevos> BEEDRILL
00:33:08<KitaFox> Psychic Pokemon had access to Barrier, Light Screen, Amnesia, Hypnosis...
00:33:38<KitaFox> They were superior status inflictors, had way higher speed, and HUGE Special stat.
00:34:00<KitaFox> All Pokemon with high Attack had low Special, and couldn't outspeed them.
00:34:16<Laevos> So basically
00:34:19<Laevos> they were #1 in the hood, G
00:34:21<KitaFox> In Gen II, they introduced Dark and Steel-type, to nerf Psychics.
00:34:37<KitaFox> And they fixed Ghost-types
00:35:05<KitaFox> They added Xatu to the list of Psychics, but he REALLY sucks.
00:35:14<Laevos> Xatu's cool though
00:35:17<Laevos> flap flap it's a bird
00:35:20<Laevos> ish
00:35:20<Laevos> thing
00:35:20<KitaFox> Looks cool
00:35:26<KitaFox> Sucks in battle.
00:35:47<KitaFox> Not strong in offense, or defense, and movepool lacks good status.
00:36:06<Laevos> Yeah but who cares about any of that stuff? ;-;
00:36:10<KitaFox> We did get Espeon.
00:36:16<KitaFox> Espeon is good.
00:36:18<Laevos> Prrprr
00:36:22<KitaFox> Espeon is REALLY good.
00:36:28<Laevos> :D
00:36:48<KitaFox> (It is a tad slower, and has less Special Attack than Alakazam, but it is a tad bulkier, though.)
00:36:50<Laevos> I liked Pokemon Colleseum (whatever it was called)
00:36:57<Laevos> because
00:37:03<Laevos> you got to use an Umbreon and an Espeon
00:37:14<KitaFox> Umby and Espy are bros.
00:37:16<Laevos> it would've been cooler if they'd like
00:37:17<Laevos> made out
00:37:18<Laevos> OTP
00:37:42<KitaFox> So, Gen II also split the Special stat into Special Attack and Special Defense.
00:37:51<KitaFox> This was, overall, good for Psychics!
00:38:11<KitaFox> Some of them received attack buffs, and defense nerfs.
00:38:23<KitaFox> Which was good, because sweeping was more viable, back then.
00:38:42<KitaFox> Then Gen III came...
00:38:54<Laevos> :ccccccc
00:38:59<KitaFox> Metagross, Gardevoir, Claydol, and ABILITIES.
00:39:06<KitaFox> All REALLY good things for the type...
00:39:27<KitaFox> But some types were changed from Special to Physical
00:39:34<KitaFox> And vice versa.
00:39:45<KitaFox> Ghosts got real attacking moves.
00:39:52<Laevos> Ghoast coming 2 get u
00:40:13<KitaFox> Bug-types received a movepool, Dark-types did too...
00:40:27<KitaFox> Some more Dark-types were introduced...
00:40:48<Laevos> Sableye
00:40:53<KitaFox> Yup.
00:41:09<Laevos> Like Spiritomb but less cool
00:41:10<KitaFox> Sableye, Absol, Mightyena, Sharpedo...
00:41:56<KitaFox> Dusclops, Banette, and Shadow Ball...
00:42:08<KitaFox> Ghost was changed from Physical to Special
00:42:23<KitaFox> So Gengar/Haunter finally got a worth-it STAB.
00:42:37<KitaFox> And then everything and their mother could learn it.
00:42:45<KitaFox> Which was good and bad for Psychics.
00:42:54<KitaFox> Psychics could finally counter Psychics...
00:42:59<KitaFox> Everything else could, too.
00:43:26<KitaFox> Gen IV brought us the Physical/Special split.
00:43:59<KitaFox> Moves were no longer given the Physical/Special flag based on type, but individually instead.
00:44:18<KitaFox> The Elemental Punches became Physical
00:44:34<Laevos> still waiting on that bug punch
00:44:44<KitaFox> We got Physical Ghost moves with STAB on Physical-stated Ghosts.
00:44:56<KitaFox> Dark Pulse
00:45:14<Laevos> sucker punch omgggg
00:45:20<KitaFox> The base 90, Dark-Type Special move that, once again, everything and their mother could learn.
00:45:25<KitaFox> Sucker Punch happened, too.
00:45:35<KitaFox> Spiritomb happened.
00:45:51<KitaFox> We got Bronzong and Gallade...
00:45:57<KitaFox> But that wasn't enough.
00:45:58<Laevos> Bronzong is cool
00:46:10<Laevos> but Spiritomb is like
00:46:10<KitaFox> Then there was 5th gen.
00:46:10<Laevos> yo
00:46:14<Laevos> check out how spooky I am
00:46:21<KitaFox> Kita almost quit the Psychic-type in 5th gen.
00:46:30<KitaFox> Hidden Abilities CRUSHED the Psychic-type.
00:46:35<KitaFox> None of them have good ones.
00:46:46<Laevos> CRUSHING DEFEAT
00:46:47<Laevos> aww
00:46:53<Laevos> and past fiveth gen I've not played
00:46:57<Laevos> so I don't know shit
00:47:02<KitaFox> Well
00:47:13<KitaFox> Gen VI changed the Steel-type.
00:47:21<KitaFox> It no longer resists Ghost or Dark
00:47:26<KitaFox> But still resists Psychic.
00:47:41<Laevos> o::::::
00:47:44<Laevos> Dark OP
00:47:50<KitaFox> Which means Metagross and Bronzong lost all their Defensive advantage.
00:47:59<KitaFox> Psychic-type received Malamar...
00:48:13<KitaFox> The worst Psychic and the worst Dark-type.
00:48:25<KitaFox> It is irredeemable.
00:48:40<Laevos> :c
00:48:47<KitaFox> It has one cool thing, which is Contrary (reverse stat changes)
00:48:57<Laevos> huh
00:49:02<KitaFox> But its stats SUCK without being boosted by it.
00:49:03<Laevos> it's also some kind of fucking squid
00:49:08<KitaFox> Well
00:49:15<Laevos> bird
00:49:20<Laevos> cuttlefish
00:49:26<KitaFox> It is a Dark/Psychic, Lovecraftian horror inspired Pokemon.
00:49:48<Laevos> It looks too sassy to be Lovecraft
00:49:55<Laevos> look at that face
00:49:57<KitaFox> And Lovecraftian horrors have tentacles, and are kind of squid-like, sometimes.
00:49:58<Laevos> it's like
00:50:06<Laevos> "I'm so done with your shit"
00:50:11<KitaFox> yeah
00:50:23<KitaFox> and it has a Base Stat Total of under 500
00:50:39<KitaFox> Which is PITIFUL for a two-stage evolved Pokemon.
00:50:45<Laevos> aww
00:50:48<KitaFox> Inkay to Malamar
00:50:54<Laevos> "Overturning pokemon"
00:51:03<Laevos> o bb
00:51:05<KitaFox> It is comparable to BUTTERFREE AND BEEDRILL in stats.
00:51:07<Laevos> u cn overturn me ne day
00:51:14<KitaFox> T^T
00:51:33<Laevos> Hey those are two-stage evolution Pokemon too
00:51:36<Laevos> rly
00:51:39 KitaFox: was so happy... Heard it was more Physically oriented... was even happier... Shitty stats...
00:51:48<KitaFox> CRUSHING DESPAIR
00:51:56<Laevos> awwwwwww
00:52:02<Laevos> it'll be okay Kita
00:52:06<KitaFox> Also, it was rumoured that Mega-Gengar would get Psychic-type
00:52:07<KitaFox> NOPE
00:52:10<KitaFox> DIDN'T HAPPEN
00:52:16<Laevos> what'd it get?
00:52:19<Laevos> GRASS?
00:52:21<KitaFox> STILL NO FUCKING PSYCHIC/GHOST
00:52:23<Laevos> oh
00:52:26<KitaFox> No. It kept Poison.
00:52:30<Laevos> oh okay
00:52:38<KitaFox> Which is good, because Poison kills Fairies
00:52:45<Laevos> :3
00:52:56<KitaFox> And Gardevoir got Fairy-type
00:53:04<KitaFox> Which is... fantastic.
00:53:18<KitaFox> It's mega-evo ALSO has Fairy, and the ability Pixilate
00:53:30<Laevos> :3
00:53:40<KitaFox> (Turns Normal-type moves to Fairy-type moves, and boosts power 33%.)
00:53:43<KitaFox> Hyper Beam.
00:53:56<KitaFox> Mega Garde becomes the Princess Dragon Slayer.
00:53:57<Laevos> It evolves from Inkay starting at level 30 while the 3DS is held upside-down.
00:54:04<Laevos> LOL
00:54:14<KitaFox> FAIRY
00:54:15<KitaFox> PRINCESS
00:54:17<KitaFox> DRAGON
00:54:18<KitaFox> SLAYER
00:54:19<Laevos> Yes that's cool too
00:54:24<Laevos> but I meant the upside-down thing
00:54:33<Laevos> what if your DS had a broken accelorometer
00:54:41<Laevos> you could literally never evolve it
00:54:42<Laevos> ever
00:54:52<KitaFox> Also, Gardevoir now resists Dark, and crushes the Dark-type with the same, Fairy-type, boosted, STAB, Hyper Beam.
00:54:58<KitaFox> You could trade it
00:55:05<Laevos> Yeah
00:55:09<Laevos> but you couldn't /evolve it/
00:55:15<Laevos> and that's what's really real
00:55:17<KitaFox> Doesn't matter.
00:55:21<Laevos> ;--------;
00:55:25<KitaFox> Malamar is shitty, anyway
00:55:27<Laevos> I don't matter Q_Q
00:55:34<KitaFox> Kita doesn't even want one.
00:55:41<KitaFox> Kita would prefer a Lilith
00:55:48<Laevos> Awwwww
00:55:50<Laevos> you're so cute
00:55:59<KitaFox> But also?
00:56:07<Laevos> let's go make out and you can tell me more about Pokemon
00:56:12<Laevos> also wise and the greatest
00:56:19<Laevos> and a Pokemon  master
00:56:22<KitaFox> Mega-Gengar has Venoshock, and is Poison-type, and has SUPER high Special Attack and the HIGHEST speed.
00:56:25<Laevos> oh
00:56:29<Laevos> also that, yeah
00:56:30<KitaFox> S
00:56:31<KitaFox> o
00:56:49<KitaFox> It can Ghost Gardevoir to death, or Poison it to death.
00:57:12<Laevos> Fastest Pokemon in the world? ;-;
00:57:33 KitaFox: believes so... Maybe not faster than the Mega Lati@s twins.
00:57:42<Laevos> Wow o.o
00:58:07<KitaFox> Base Speed Stat of 145.
00:58:39<KitaFox> Oh
00:58:40<Laevos> Bulbapedia says 130 ;-;
00:58:50<KitaFox> 130? For Gengar or Mega Gengar?
00:59:00<Laevos> bo...th?
00:59:04<Laevos> It's not clear
00:59:05<KitaFox> That's not right
00:59:12<Laevos> Gengar (Mega Gengar)
00:59:22<Laevos> http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_base_stats_(Generation_VI-present)
00:59:23<KitaFox> 1) Always check Serebii.net first
01:00:03<KitaFox> Okay
01:00:14<Laevos> Seribii says... 110? o.O
01:00:23<KitaFox> It is 130 for Mega Gengar
01:00:33<KitaFox> It was Special Attack that was highest
01:00:34<Laevos> o
01:00:37<Laevos> oooooohhhhhhhhh
01:01:01<Laevos> Besides Mega Alakazam?
01:01:30<KitaFox> Only Mega Mewtwo X and Y and Mega Alakazam have more Special Attack
01:01:45<Laevos> and apparently Attack Forme Deoxys
01:02:00<KitaFox> Is Attack Forme 180?
01:02:01<Laevos> apparently Mega Mewtwo X actually has /less/ t han mega Gengar
01:02:05<Laevos> ya
01:02:11 KitaFox: shrugs, doesn't use Legendaries.
01:02:24<Laevos> that's why I didn't list Mewtwo or Deoxys
01:02:32<Laevos> I figured you weren't counting them
01:02:44 KitaFox: would not, normally
01:03:06<Laevos> so why does Mewtwo get to be so cool?
01:03:07<KitaFox> All the super good Psychics, now, are Legendaries.
01:03:22<KitaFox> Mewtwo was specifically engineered to be the most powerful Pokemon.
01:03:41<KitaFox> As time went on, and its type got nerfed and nerfed...
01:03:52<KitaFox> They had to do something to keep it up high.
01:04:02<Laevos> we set out to create the world's strongest Pokemon...
01:04:05<KitaFox> It has the highest BST out of any Pokemon, when Mega-Evolved.
01:04:12<Laevos> and we [partially] succeeded...
01:04:19<KitaFox> No... They succeeded.
01:04:36<Laevos> yes
01:04:38<Laevos> AND WE SUCCEEDED
01:04:39<KitaFox> Darkrai is, jokingly, touted as the most powerful...
01:04:44<Laevos> lol
01:04:45<Laevos> wat a shit
01:04:49<KitaFox> Because it has Dark Void.
01:04:53<Laevos> w/e
01:04:59<Laevos> you know what else has dark void
01:05:02<Laevos> their booty
01:05:14<KitaFox> 100% accuracy, auto-sleep, and Darkrai has Bad Dreams, which auto-inflicts Nightmare status.
01:05:32<Laevos> Yeah I mean that is pretty threatening
01:05:35<KitaFox> Mega Mewtwo Y?
01:05:37<KitaFox> Insomnia.
01:05:43<KitaFox> Can't sleep
01:05:48<Laevos> gg no re
01:05:58<KitaFox> Mega Mewtwo X? Fighting-type.
01:06:17<Laevos> gg no re
01:06:25<KitaFox> Darkrai is now the SOLE reason for Sleep Clause.
01:06:36<Laevos> Pfffft xD
01:07:46<Laevos> What if they tried to make a Mewtwo but actually it was a Sunkern instead?
01:07:55<Laevos> What do you think they would do, Kita?
01:07:55<KitaFox> :P
01:07:58<KitaFox> Fuck Sunkern.
01:08:03<Laevos> where?
01:08:09<Laevos> and WITH WHAT?
01:08:11<KitaFox> IN THE MOUTH
01:08:17<KitaFox> WITH A JOLTEON DICK
01:08:18<Laevos> it's so little
01:08:21<Laevos> lol
01:08:45<Laevos> Sunkern's pretty hot tbh
01:08:50<KitaFox> But uhhh
01:08:52<KitaFox> Yeah
01:08:55<KitaFox> Psychic-type
01:08:58<Laevos> Yeah
01:08:58<Laevos> that
01:09:04<Laevos> Sorry it got all
01:09:06<Laevos> pooped on :c
01:09:06<KitaFox> Gets shafted every generation
01:09:16<KitaFox> No one seems to care.
01:09:19<Laevos> :cc
01:09:28<Laevos> Maybe its dominance in Gen I was like
01:09:29<KitaFox> Everyone was happy about the Steel-type nerf...
01:09:32<Laevos> the Holocaust of Pokemon
01:09:41<Laevos> where they were like
01:09:42<KitaFox> Except for mono-Psychic users.
01:09:43<Laevos> NEVER AGAIN
01:09:43<KitaFox> ;.;
01:09:57<KitaFox> People are pissed about the Dragon-nerfing
01:10:05<KitaFox> And the Poison-boosting
01:10:15<Laevos> let me know when there's a steel dragon or a bug dragon
01:10:20<KitaFox> And people are pissed about the Dark-type boosting.
01:10:34<KitaFox> But no one cared about Psychic-type
01:10:35<Laevos> I'm okay with that
01:10:36<Laevos> 666
01:10:38<Laevos> but
01:10:43<Laevos> Psychic should be good too ;-;
01:11:15<KitaFox> There was a reason Kita's badge featured Metagross' X on it.
01:11:27<KitaFox> The big, silver X, on its face.
01:11:31<Laevos> Q~Q
01:11:50<Laevos> I-It'll be okay, Kita-chan ;-;
01:11:55<KitaFox> Tank, Tank, Tank, Explosion.
01:11:57<Laevos> Psychic will rise again
01:12:22<KitaFox> Telepathy, Clerical Gardevoir + Exploding Tank Metagross.
01:12:39<Laevos> ...:3
01:12:43<Laevos> that's rly clever
01:12:46<KitaFox> Metagross had Meteor Mash, Earthquake, Bullet Punch, and Explosion.
01:12:59<Laevos> Hehehehe xux
01:13:11<KitaFox> Gardevoir had Gravity, Heal Pulse, Calm Mind, and Shadow Ball.
01:13:29<Laevos> Nice
01:13:40<KitaFox> Telepathy prevented Metagross' attacks from hurting Gardevoir.
01:14:09<KitaFox> Gravity brought down Flying-type and Levitate Pokemon, to EAT FUCKING GROUND-TYPE DAMAGE.
01:14:20<Laevos> czf
01:14:20<KitaFox> Heal Pulse to wall with the 'Gross.
01:14:23<Laevos> xD
01:14:42<KitaFox> And Explosion as last resort.
01:14:51<Laevos> ragequit
01:15:12<KitaFox> Quick Claw Heal Pulse, to protect the 'Gross for one last turn, before KRAKAKOOM.
01:15:42<Laevos> XjX
01:15:56<Laevos> err
01:15:58<KitaFox> And then Gardevoir remains standing, Troll Face Activated, ready to Calm Mind and Shadow Ball, or to Cleric for the Gallade.
01:15:59<Laevos> XuX, I mean
01:16:09<Laevos> yay :D
01:16:22<Laevos> Ugh, slow connection to my server
01:16:22 KitaFox: Gallade/Gardevoir combo'd/
01:16:45<KitaFox> That worked in Fifth gen.
01:16:58 KitaFox: was running one of the best Mono-Psychic teams in the metagame.
01:17:21<Laevos> In the WORLD
01:17:26 KitaFox: even utilised Focus Sash, Analytic, Trick Room Starmie.
01:18:42<Laevos> Oooh c:
01:18:53<KitaFox> Trick Room changes turn order
01:19:03<KitaFox> Focus Sash soaks the next turn damage
01:19:10<KitaFox> Analytic boosts move power.
01:19:27<KitaFox> (But only if you go last.)
01:19:36<Laevos> xD
01:19:48<Laevos> Good thinking
01:19:59<KitaFox> It sounds useless on a fast Pokemon.
01:20:04<KitaFox> Works for Psychics.
01:20:21<KitaFox> Kita had a Trick Room Mono-Psychic, and a Tailwind Mono-Psychic.
01:20:38<KitaFox> Metagross + Gardevoir was Tailwind
01:21:16<KitaFox> They punched a hole in the team, so that Gallade + Sigilyph could Tailwind to boost priority and Sweep.
01:21:25<Laevos> ouo
01:22:08<KitaFox> Trick Room was Starmie, Slowbro, Claydol and Reuniclus.
01:22:52<KitaFox> Starmie + Claydol first
01:22:57<Laevos> Kita's so good at Pokemon :3
01:23:02<KitaFox> Slowbro + Reuniclus second.
01:24:44<Laevos> ugh
01:24:47<Laevos> I'm so so sleepy
01:24:49<Laevos> BT
01:24:51<Laevos> BUT*
01:24:57<Laevos> I wanna keep listening to Kita
01:25:01<Laevos> forever ;;;;;;;-;
01:25:04 KitaFox: lick grooms
01:25:13 Laevos: purrflops
01:25:26<Laevos> Kita help
01:25:30 KitaFox: has decided to switch to Steel-type
01:25:37<Laevos> Ooh o:
01:25:40<Laevos> Good luck :3
01:26:16<KitaFox> Mega-Aggron
01:26:33<Laevos> @u@
01:26:33<KitaFox> Or Mega-Scizor
01:26:36 KitaFox: kisses on
01:26:41<Laevos> That sounds super cool
01:28:19 Laevos: blushes and kisses back <3
01:28:32<Laevos> Kitafox, I have a crush on you ;///////;
01:28:43<KitaFox> D'awwwr
01:29:11<Laevos> better get out while you have the chance or I'll end up writing you a sappy letter and putting it in your locker ;-;
01:29:21<KitaFox> XP
01:29:43<Laevos> Don't think I won't! ;n;
01:31:09<Laevos> and I why wouldn't I be, Kita's so fun and insightful and calming and sweet and smart ;u;
01:32:13<Laevos> sorry if that's literally too sappy to even withstand Q_Q
01:32:46<Laevos> really out of it and clingy and floaty
01:36:18 KitaFox: lickgrooms, lovingly

11:17:02 Laevos: clings
11:17:05<KitaFox> ?
11:20:33<Laevos> panic attack
11:20:37<Laevos> earlier
11:21:21<KitaFox> Over what?
11:22:13<Laevos> accidentally saying something in a channel that wasn't meant for it ;-;
11:22:23<KitaFox> Oh
11:22:32<Laevos> Stupid things v_v
11:22:38<Laevos> I was just tense already
11:22:52<Laevos> and that just made me break down completely
11:22:55<Laevos> I feel pathetic x_x
11:22:56<KitaFox> Did anyone get weirded out or upset at you?
11:23:01<Laevos> no
11:23:12<Laevos> but I was embarrassed
11:23:15<Laevos> and ashamed
11:23:15 KitaFox: rubrubs her chin.
11:24:13<KitaFox> Kita would, accidentally, post replies to sex RPs in her channel.
11:24:27<KitaFox> Every once in a while.
11:24:42 Laevos: nods...
11:24:50<Laevos> that has happened to me before, too v_v
11:25:15<Laevos> this one was just me saying "I should probably fap x_x" but I was immediately mortified
11:25:30 KitaFox: licks her ears.
11:26:23 Laevos: collapses
11:26:41<Laevos> panicked so much that I curled up into a ball instead of taking a shower and wasn't able to get out of the house to go to school
11:27:04<KitaFox> Oh baby....
11:27:33<Laevos> completely fell apart...
11:29:07 KitaFox: offers some orange sherbert.
11:29:27 Laevos: licks
11:30:03<KitaFox> <3
11:30:16<Laevos> <3 ;-;
11:32:41 KitaFox: patpats her tummy and snuggles up to.
11:33:12 Laevos: curls up on, loves her Goddess ;-;
11:34:08<KitaFox> It'll be okay.
11:39:03 Laevos: kisses and nods, snuggling <3
11:42:17 KitaFox: is scribbling out some generic D&D3.5 soldiers
11:42:32<Laevos> Yay :3
11:43:16<KitaFox> For Army VS Army encounter.
11:45:35<Laevos> Going to be running a campaign soon? o:
11:46:19<KitaFox> No...
11:46:25<KitaFox> Just practice...
11:47:47<Laevos> Oh, okay
11:47:53 Laevos: kisses
11:48:07<KitaFox> Gotta have Fighters and Rangers
11:48:19<KitaFox> Can't forget a few Clerics and Wizards
11:48:27<KitaFox> But mostly Fighters and Rangers.
11:48:35<KitaFox> A couple Rogues sprinkled about.
11:48:53<KitaFox> And one Paladin, who technically commands the Clerics.
11:51:11<Laevos> Yus :3
11:51:59<KitaFox> Mostly humans.
11:52:09<KitaFox> A couple of the Rangers are Half-Elves.
11:52:22<KitaFox> One of the rogues is a Halfling.
11:52:44<KitaFox> And a select portion of the Fighters are Half-Orcs

12:02:11 Laevos: nodnods
12:02:20<Laevos> Can we play D&D sometime? ;-;
12:03:09<KitaFox> Do you GM?
12:06:46<Laevos> If needed ;w;
12:07:59 KitaFox: licks her nose
12:08:14 KitaFox: has GM'd before. Never again.
12:08:28<KitaFox> Tried to do a Pokemon Tabletop Adventures game...
12:09:03<KitaFox> At the end of the (optional) Forest path Kita had (where they were given Pokemon Eggs)
12:09:09<KitaFox> There was a Beedrill boss.
12:09:32<KitaFox> They were supposed to work together, and they did! Just not how Kita expected.
12:09:38<Laevos> Awww ;-;
12:09:40<Laevos> what'd they do?
12:09:45<KitaFox> Well
12:09:52<KitaFox> One of them caught the fucking Beedrill.
12:09:56<Laevos> :DDDDD
12:10:01<KitaFox> Not good!
12:10:04<KitaFox> D:
12:10:11<Laevos> You gotta make planz for that
12:10:17<KitaFox> It was 10 levels higher than EVERYTHING else.
12:10:34<Laevos> Would it have even obeyed them? ;n;
12:10:38<KitaFox> It wasn't supposed to be capturable by their Trainer level.
12:10:44<KitaFox> Because they caught it, yes.
12:11:00<KitaFox> (Only traded Pokemon disobey commands, or abused Pokemon.)
12:11:23<KitaFox> But she got a Critical Capture after a Critical Hit.
12:13:31<Laevos> Oh, okay
12:13:55 KitaFox: whimpers.
12:15:03<KitaFox> She then used the Beedrill to completely sweep the entire first island, boost her trainer level to get EXP boost, and then Swap-Train her Starter until it was a high enough level for her to forget about the Beedrill.
12:15:16 KitaFox: gave every Pokemon she could Pursuit.
12:15:25<Laevos> Q_Q
12:15:26<KitaFox> But the other player was a Medic.
12:15:32<KitaFox> And just healed her.
12:15:38<Laevos> oh no ;-;
12:16:18 KitaFox: flops
12:16:46 Laevos: snuggles
12:16:48<Laevos> should shower soon
12:17:46<KitaFox> o.o
12:18:26<Laevos> ;-;
12:18:28<Laevos> well it's true
12:18:29<Laevos> I should
12:18:40<Laevos> I've been laying in the bathroom for like three hours
12:19:37 KitaFox: rubs her ears.
12:19:49<KitaFox> Is that where you are, now?
12:19:58<Laevos> Yes @_@
12:20:05<Laevos> at my mom's house in the really little shower... room thing
12:21:35<KitaFox> Awwwr
12:24:16<Laevos> this shower could definitely not be shared
12:24:22<Laevos> barely evenough room for even me to curl up in @_@
12:24:40<KitaFox> o.o
12:25:07<Laevos> it's a very small room, like a side room of the bathroom
12:26:16<KitaFox> Weird
12:29:35<Laevos> Nevermind, back now
12:29:44<Laevos> and yeah
12:29:49<Laevos> when I was little
12:30:01<Laevos> I used to curl up in here while the water ran and kind of drift off
12:30:07<KitaFox> Awwwr
12:30:14<KitaFox> You sound like Woofles.
12:30:15<KitaFox> X3
12:30:16<Laevos> like when my dad was showering
12:30:17<Laevos> oh? o_o
12:31:42<KitaFox> Woofles will sometimes curl up in the shower and run water
12:32:10<Laevos> same @_@
12:33:20 KitaFox: is gonna go shower in her large, ceiling mounted head, shower.
12:33:30<KitaFox> :P
12:33:45<KitaFox> It even has a seat in it.
12:33:55<Laevos> Yay :D
12:33:58<Laevos> That sounds great ;u;
12:34:20<KitaFox> The seat is so Kita can spend the time she needs to on her hair.
12:35:41<Laevos> Yay :3

15:27:00<Laevos> Class went fine
15:27:10<Laevos> I got a bit emotional when making my points, but it was okay
15:27:26<KitaFox> :D
15:27:33<KitaFox> http://i.imgur.com/SsVgDAS.jpg
15:27:35<KitaFox> SFW
15:27:36<Laevos> SFW?
15:27:37<Laevos> oh
15:27:38<Laevos> :D
15:27:46<Laevos> Oh hey I've seen this
15:28:11<Laevos> hehehehe
15:28:12<KitaFox> Everything in this chart is, scientifically, unsubstantiated and lacks real evidence.
15:28:16<Laevos> "Circumcision"
15:28:45<Laevos> Yeah, it doesn't really have much of an effect
15:28:50<Laevos> makes cleaning marginally easier
15:29:05<KitaFox> It does have an effect, supposedly.
15:29:14<Laevos> well
15:29:19<Laevos> it can make the glans less sensitive
15:29:22<Laevos> since they rub up against things
15:29:27<KitaFox> Yeah
15:29:35<KitaFox> Tha
15:29:36<KitaFox> t
15:29:41<KitaFox> Is a negative effect
15:29:48<Laevos> Not... necessarily?
15:29:56<Laevos> well, there are positives and negatives
15:30:22<KitaFox> It is probably the leading cause of erectile dysfunction.
15:30:24<KitaFox> :<
15:30:25<Laevos> /possible/ positives and negatives
15:30:33<KitaFox> Which, even for a lesbian, is a sad thing.
15:30:40<Laevos> It is? o.o
15:31:06<KitaFox> because then sexually frustrated, circumcised Republicans exert that frustration in opression of Kita's sexuality.
15:31:06<KitaFox> :<
15:31:39<Laevos> oh okay
15:31:52<Laevos> Hmm
15:32:03<Laevos> it is sometimes difficult for my partners to get me to orgasm
15:32:05<Laevos> but not impossible
15:32:23<KitaFox> Yeah
15:32:26<KitaFox> ?
15:32:43<Laevos> because of reduced sensitivity, I suppose
15:33:00<Laevos> BUT
15:33:06<Laevos> I think it might be psychological, too
15:33:17<Laevos> because of bad experiences with my first partner
15:33:32<KitaFox> Maybe!
15:33:35<Laevos> I get kind of... nervous when attempting non-oral penetration because it... didn't work @_@
15:34:09<KitaFox> o.o
15:34:12<KitaFox> Didn't work?
15:34:20<Laevos> I didn't... erm... fit x_x
15:34:33<KitaFox> XP
15:34:35<KitaFox> It happens
15:34:41<Laevos> and I could tell that he was disappointed and that made me freak out and lose all my confidence in the act for a while
15:35:13<KitaFox> Hey
15:35:15<Laevos> Hey
15:35:17<KitaFox> It isn't YOUR fault
15:35:20<KitaFox> He was too small.
15:35:22<KitaFox> Dick.
15:35:32<Laevos> well
15:35:36<Laevos> I also had no idea what I was doing
15:35:53<Laevos> and probably didn't do enough to reduce the tension
15:36:04<Laevos> of meeting somebody from ~400 miles away for the first time
15:36:11<KitaFox> Awwwr
15:36:18<KitaFox> You should always take things slow!
15:36:24<KitaFox> And do your research.
15:36:26 KitaFox: nods.
15:36:32<Laevos> Well I DIDN'T
15:36:34<KitaFox> Unless it is just a casual hook-up.
15:36:36<Laevos> It was my first time
15:36:38<Laevos> I dunno
15:36:40<Laevos> semi-casual
15:36:44<KitaFox> Yeah
15:36:45<Laevos> but also not
15:36:54<Laevos> he was the first person I considered an actual partner
15:36:59<KitaFox> :<
15:37:07<KitaFox> Unfortunate that your first time sucked.
15:37:10<Laevos> and not just some 25-60 year old guy that I'd do camwhore type things for
15:37:15<Laevos> it wasn't all bad
15:37:25<Laevos> I got my first kiss and found out I really like making out
15:37:52<KitaFox> X3
15:38:04<Laevos> so I guess that encounter was a bit of a roller coaster
15:38:41<Laevos> also found out that certain kinds of very oily lube feel absolutely disgusting and render me completely incapable of most intimacy x_x
15:38:49<Laevos> because I LOATHE the feeling of oil on my skin
15:39:06<Laevos> if I accidentally touch butter or cooking oil I start to spasm and freak out until I can wash it off x_x
15:40:46<KitaFox> o.O
15:41:27<Laevos> Yeah, it's one of my... I dunno
15:41:30<Laevos> character traits
15:41:33<Laevos> \(o.o)/
15:42:00<KitaFox> Phobia of oil upon skin
15:42:14<Laevos> I suppose
15:42:33<Laevos> the thought of it doesn't necessarily have the same effect... but anything that resembles that sensation induces severe dysphoria
15:42:54<KitaFox> Like
15:42:58<KitaFox> Gender dysphoria?
15:43:07<Laevos> body dysphoria
15:43:15<KitaFox> Ah
15:43:19<Laevos> I don't like existing as a body that's in contact with oil
15:48:03<Laevos> but the gender dysphoria thing sometimes comes up
15:50:44 Laevos: licks
15:51:05<KitaFox> Well
15:51:31<KitaFox> It is common in transgender individuals for gender dysphoria to wax and wane.
15:51:40<Laevos> ;n;
15:51:44<Laevos> I don't know what I want to look like
15:51:55<KitaFox> It is.. sometimes mistaken for bipolar disorder.
15:52:04<KitaFox> You should check out /r/transgender
15:52:09<Laevos> I can't :c
15:52:11<KitaFox> And /r/asktransgender
15:52:13<Laevos> can't
15:52:15<KitaFox> Why
15:52:19<Laevos> I can't go on reddit
15:52:29<KitaFox> Not all of reddit is evil
15:52:34<Laevos> Perhaps not
15:52:37<Laevos> but a vow is a vow
15:52:40<KitaFox> In fact...
15:52:42<Laevos> and Lilith is a being of her word
15:52:50<KitaFox> Truey is like that, too.
15:52:57<Laevos> not going on Reddit? :D
15:52:59<KitaFox> And it hurts him, more than helps him.
15:53:00<KitaFox> No.
15:53:08<Laevos> well
15:53:18<KitaFox> Making weird promises, and sticking to them, despite their being ill to his being.
15:53:34<Laevos> I never said that I didn't engage in self-destructive behavior for a misplaced sense of necessity
15:53:40<Laevos> quite the contrary, dear Goddess!
15:54:13<KitaFox> Well, /r/transgender and /r/asktransgender, together, are the largest trans-safe space on the internet.
15:54:29<KitaFox> And the community is a very positive, accepting place.
15:54:32<Laevos> I'll have to find some smaller ones, then
15:54:38<Laevos> anyway, I don't like being in the largest anything o_o
15:55:21<KitaFox> Does Lilith know why that infographic is on Kita's computer?
15:56:11<Laevos> what infographic?
15:56:24<KitaFox> The one she posted a little bit ago.
15:56:44<KitaFox> The Irrational Nonsense one.
15:56:53<Laevos> oh that
15:57:02<Laevos> because you save infographics?
15:57:03<Laevos> I don't know
15:57:56<KitaFox> Because Kita finds irrational self-destructive behaviours to be distasteful... Not avoidable or irradicatable...
15:58:13<KitaFox> But distasteful, and thinks that people should strive to be above it.
15:58:15<Laevos> I consider not going on reddit to be in my best interest
15:58:35<KitaFox> The one should overcome their self-destructive behaviours... Not accede to them.
15:58:38<Laevos> Kind of a... I don't agree with the principle of the site, so I refuse to give it patronage
15:59:06<KitaFox> The principle?
15:59:16<KitaFox> People sharing stuff?
15:59:26<Laevos> The overall ~vibes~ I get from the community
15:59:29<KitaFox> Communication? Collaboration?
15:59:32<Laevos> i.e., snarky little brats
15:59:48<KitaFox> Did you ever go to a subreddit that wasn't a front page?
15:59:54<KitaFox> A default sub?
15:59:55<Laevos> I've never gone to reddit once in my life
15:59:59<Laevos> I'm rather proud of that :D
16:00:03<KitaFox> Then how do you know?
16:00:13<Laevos> What people have told me, shown me through example
16:00:30<Laevos> People whose opinions I trust, mind
16:00:32<Laevos> not just random folks
16:00:44<KitaFox> and you're going to let the opinions of others shape and mold your opinions without at least experiencing it for yourself?
16:00:55<KitaFox> Lilith trusts Kita, but Kita is capable of being wrong.
16:01:00<KitaFox> at least
16:01:05<Laevos> Since it appears like the kind of thing that would be detrimental to me
16:01:09<KitaFox> Kita thinks Lilith trusts Kita.
16:01:18<Laevos> I trust Kita <3
16:01:37<KitaFox> Kita thinks that, properly used, it could be a source of community and entertainment to Laevos.
16:01:47<Laevos> It wouldn't be
16:01:59<KitaFox> :P
16:02:01<Laevos> it's in the same place in my mind as 9gag and memecenter or whatever it is
16:02:06<Laevos> utterly of no interest to me
16:02:10<Laevos> anyway
16:02:20<Laevos> I don't have a policy of needing to try things to make judgments on whether or not they're for me
16:02:41<Laevos> see also: alcohol and other drugs, the former I've had to defend my stance on quite regularly
16:03:21<KitaFox> Actually, reddit was originally created by members of the engineering and science communities to, anonymously, share the projects, ideas, and theories they were working with, and discuss them openly and publicly.
16:03:34<Laevos> I hate the engineering and science communities
16:03:36<Laevos> fuck those guys!
16:03:43<Laevos> :D
16:03:55<KitaFox> But you're using a computer, and the internet.
16:03:58<KitaFox> :|
16:04:04<Laevos> Out of  necessity
16:04:20<Laevos> I'm not what one would call capable of, y'know, wilderness survival
16:04:43<Laevos> just because I use technology a lot doesn't mean I like the people that are responsible for it
16:04:44<KitaFox> So you rely on things created by people you despise?
16:04:47<Laevos> Sure!
16:04:48<Laevos> Who doesn't? :P
16:05:43<KitaFox> Kita does her best to avoid it, and can't necessarily come up with any instances where she does...
16:05:57<Laevos> I listen to music by people I find utterly reprehensible, for instance
16:06:18<Laevos> Really dumb, far-right types
16:06:20<KitaFox> Kita does not.
16:06:31<Laevos> if it makes its way into their music itself, the message of the music, that's another story
16:06:53<Laevos> but I wouldn't be able to listen to much black metal if I didn't listen to any by people who also happened to have conservative outlooks
16:07:33 KitaFox: doesn't really listen to Black metal, kind of for that reason. :<
16:07:41<KitaFox> Black Metal*
16:07:48<Laevos> that's fine
16:07:51<Laevos> there's nothing wrong with that
16:08:03<Laevos> it's one of like three genres that I enjoy though, so
16:08:11<Laevos> I kinda' have to bite the bullet
16:08:40<KitaFox> Or you could advertise the fact that you would prefer to not, but like the sound of the genre.
16:08:45<KitaFox> Someone will latch onto the idea.
16:08:45<Laevos> Yeah right
16:08:52<Laevos> People make left-leaning black metal
16:08:54<Laevos> the problem is
16:08:57<Laevos> most of it is complete shit
16:09:16<Laevos> Wolves in the Throne Room being a contemporary example
16:09:31<KitaFox> The music itself could be apolitical, but the people could be less dispicable.
16:09:37<Laevos> Well
16:09:50<Laevos> I don't go out of my way to verify the political backgrounds of band members
16:09:52<Laevos> if I can avoid it, haha
16:10:23 KitaFox: nibbles on
16:10:31<KitaFox> Because you don't like what you find.
16:10:35<Laevos> Sure
16:10:36<Laevos> I mean
16:10:40<Laevos> I don't listen to political music
16:10:44<Laevos> if I can avoid it
16:10:53<Laevos> if the band's going to go out of their way to make it the central message
16:10:55<Laevos> it probably sucks!
16:11:25<Laevos> whether it's left- or right-leaning, rly
16:11:27 KitaFox: sometimes listens to anarchist music, because sometimes it takes anarchy to bring down oppressive forces, so she doesn't disagree with temporary anarchy.
16:11:44<Laevos> I find anarchy pretty reprehensible, haha xD
16:11:57<Laevos> I love governments <3
16:12:09<KitaFox> Anarchy has proven to be effective at dethroning BAD governments.
16:12:14<KitaFox> Hence... Temporary anarchy.
16:12:14<Laevos> Yeah and then...? :P
16:12:19<Laevos> uh-huh :P
16:12:26<Laevos> I'm not for that kind of... eh, radicalism I guess
16:12:39<Laevos> at least not in that sense
16:12:49<KitaFox> Kita likes to avoid it, but cannot argue with its effectiveness over the years...
16:12:53<Laevos> I mean
16:13:01<Laevos> I lean more toward being a communist than anything else, tbh
16:13:19<KitaFox> The word communist has so many negative implications.
16:13:25<Laevos> Yeah, it does
16:13:30<Laevos> and yet it's never actually been attempted on this planet :c
16:13:35<Laevos> communism, that is
16:13:37<KitaFox> Kita perfers the more happily-oriented Humanist.
16:13:59<Laevos> Humanism's fine, and should definitely be a pillar of any and all future communist governments :D
16:14:22<KitaFox> And communism isn't perfect.
16:14:28<KitaFox> But we've never worked out the tweaks.
16:14:36<KitaFox> Because we've never implemented.
16:14:36<Laevos> It'd have to actually be implemented first
16:14:38<Laevos> yeah
16:14:48<Laevos> I'm okay with socalism, too
16:14:50<Laevos> whatever we can manage
16:14:51<KitaFox> Actually... That isn't true.
16:14:52<Laevos> or scrap up
16:15:04<Laevos> Uh, go on? o.o
16:15:08<KitaFox> It HAS been implemented, but immediately overthrown or converted to dictatorship.
16:15:27<Laevos> Practically speaking, that doesn't really... count :\
16:15:47<KitaFox> No, but it DOES identify a large problem.
16:16:07<KitaFox> The system is easily corruptable.
16:16:20<Laevos> Ehh...
16:16:26<KitaFox> In the early stages!
16:16:33<KitaFox> We've not seen the later stages.
16:16:39<Laevos> I would say that the fact that it's never been implemented, I'd argue even attempted to be implemented, make those speculations completely without merit
16:16:51<Laevos> I can't agree that it's ever been implemented, overthrown, anything
16:17:05<Laevos> in the Marxist actualizatoin
16:17:09<Laevos> *actualization
16:17:35<KitaFox> Lenin and Trotsky were both actualisation attempts. Both were overthrown by Stalin
16:18:15<KitaFox> Had the world gone to Lenin, we would have seen Communism.
16:18:20<KitaFox> Trotsky? Socialism.
16:18:28<Laevos> Speculation like that is of no interest to me :/
16:18:33<KitaFox> But the world went Stalin, so we saw Dictatorship.
16:18:44<Laevos> I don't think Russia was ready to make that leap
16:19:09<Laevos> didn't have the requisite stability, I don't think
16:19:12<KitaFox> No one is, really.
16:19:37<Laevos> bleh
16:19:43<KitaFox> Maybe post-economic depression, pre-WWII America...
16:19:50<Laevos> whatever
16:19:54<Laevos> I'm not interested in discussing it anymore
16:19:59<KitaFox> Okay.
16:20:00<KitaFox> :<
16:20:02<Laevos> sorry
16:20:05<Laevos> I just got really depressed
16:20:17<Laevos> I think it's really imperative that people stop putting so much worth into competition
16:20:21<Laevos> it's a horrible, destructive force
16:20:33<Laevos> capitalism should be eradicated... sports should be eradicated... x_x
16:20:37<KitaFox> Pure competition*
16:21:01<Laevos> I dunno what the distinction is between that and 'impure competition' and don't know that it'll change my outlook in the slightest :/
16:21:12<Laevos> people should cooperate
16:21:13<Laevos> not compete
16:22:08<KitaFox> Humans are a species raised in blood, pain, and muddy politics. Competition is a good outlet for the instincts that linger in the survivors.
16:22:22<KitaFox> Competition should not be a source of financial stability...
16:22:26<KitaFox> But entertainment.
16:23:09<KitaFox> And it should never encourage violent behaviours, but instead finitely-tuned skillcrafting.
16:23:16<Laevos> I've heard people say that, what was it...
16:23:24<Laevos> if sports weren't a thing, rates of murder would go way up
16:23:30<Laevos> that we'd need a national bloodsport or something
16:23:33<Laevos> I think that's bullshit
16:23:47<KitaFox> We don't need a national bloodsport...
16:23:54<Laevos> I'm not capable of taking on such a defeatist attitude
16:24:22<Laevos> and if I were I'd also have to accept that I live as part of a species that I'm incapable of reconciling my morality with on a fundamental level, the only outcome of which would be immediate self-termination
16:25:08<KitaFox> Kita is not saying humans need boxing or football or fencing or shoot outs.
16:25:43<KitaFox> Kita is saying that Olympic Events, like swimming and shot-put throwing are actually quite effective in creating a non-violent spirit of competition.
16:26:07<Laevos> I don't think that violence is the core problem, though it is a very serious side effect
16:26:23<Laevos> I think the main problem is competition itself, individuals and groups trying to be better than those around them
16:26:44<KitaFox> It makes for good entertainment, and is a reflection of human history.
16:27:02<Laevos> We should develop better entertainment that doesn't encourage such :/
16:27:33<KitaFox> People don't NEED to be competitive... But being competitive has, overall, made people happy.
16:27:47<Laevos> some people
16:27:53<Laevos> it's also caused a great deal of suffering
16:28:02<Laevos> I think it's the fundamental root of a lot of problems
16:28:12<Laevos> and we need to re-structure our world so that it is not a part of it
16:28:19<Laevos> rather than trying to always accomodate for it in some way or another
16:28:33<KitaFox> Or, you could just take away its ability to cause suffering.
16:28:49<Laevos> that doesn't seem plausible to me
16:28:57<Laevos> and still just seems to be another way of accomodation
16:29:09<KitaFox> Its compromise.
16:29:26<KitaFox> And without compromise, nothing changes.
16:29:32<Laevos> Lilith is an extremist, she supposes
16:30:03<KitaFox> because people are fundamentally different. They aren't the same. They have individuality. They are capable of separating themselves from the collective.
16:30:09<KitaFox> It is the price of sentience.
16:30:18<Laevos> oh well
16:30:28<Laevos> then this world wasn't meant for Lilith
16:30:49<KitaFox> Or, Lilith could attempt to compromise with the world.
16:31:10<KitaFox> She could work to try to make the world better!
16:31:18<Laevos> I'm too weak
16:31:27<KitaFox> One person can't do it alone, but it'll never happen without one person to start it.
16:31:28<Laevos> I don't have the capacity to change anything
16:31:35<KitaFox> Yet
16:31:37<Laevos> no 'fight' in me
16:31:45<KitaFox> You could build that capacity.
16:31:47<Laevos> I'll only become less passive as years go on
16:31:59<Laevos> and my energy withers away with the rest of my body
16:32:17<KitaFox> Even saying something, just planting the idea, could be enough to start movement.
16:32:19<Laevos> until my all-too-transient dust blows away forever, making me nothing more than a part of the worthless air
16:32:24<KitaFox> Just gotta find someone less passive.
16:33:17<KitaFox> Or... Lilith could continue her path of self-destructive self-hatred... And have a 0% chance of changing things, instead of an almost 0% chance.
16:33:22<KitaFox> A chance is a chance.
16:33:22<Laevos> yes
16:33:26<Laevos> the former sounds good
16:33:33<Laevos> tear myself apart with my frustration at the world
16:33:38<Laevos> it sounds like the best course of action
16:33:46<KitaFox> Not really.
16:33:53<Laevos> it will make some people sad but
16:33:54<KitaFox> It sounds like the path to ultimate sadness.
16:33:55<KitaFox> :<
16:33:58<Laevos> someday they'll all be dead too
16:34:47<Laevos> their lives will have had other things in them to help them forget that I ever existed
16:34:59<KitaFox> Minimise potential and actual suffering; Maximise potential and actual happiness.
16:35:15<Laevos> that's all well and good, but...
16:35:33<Laevos> I can't go through life alone; it's been made clear that I'll be expected to
16:35:43<Laevos> never to have anyone of my own, because of my own folly
16:35:56<Laevos> because I'm setting myself up for completely isolation
16:35:56<KitaFox> Kita is here... Lilith doesn't have to be alone, always.
16:36:24<Laevos> Kita does not want Lilith to be near her, a fact for which she holds no grudge against her Goddess. Lilith would not want her to be near her either, if she were anyone else
16:36:49<KitaFox> This is not true.
16:37:10<KitaFox> Kita just has to work over an irrational fear of face-to-face contact.
16:37:17<KitaFox> Which is difficult.
16:37:22<KitaFox> But not impossible.
16:37:29<Laevos> Lilith is not saying that any of this is Kita's fault ;~;
16:37:37<KitaFox> Kita WANTS Lilith here, but she is, at the same time, AFRAID of it.
16:38:16<Laevos> and Lilith will not ever press the issue... Kita deserves to not have to be afraid or put into uncomfortable situations
16:38:27<KitaFox> Just like how Lilith is probably transgender, but is afraid of such a label and what it implies.
16:38:33 KitaFox: licks.
16:38:45<Laevos> Lilith currently calls herself genderqueer
16:38:47<Laevos> partially because
16:38:57<KitaFox> That is a tough label, too.
16:39:11<Laevos> she doesn't expect to ever go on hormones, or get surgery, or do anything to make her outward appearance any less 'masculine'
16:39:19<KitaFox> Transgender is just a specific type of genderqueer.
16:40:11 KitaFox: nuzzles.
16:40:28<Laevos> so Lilith will probably... always have a form that Kita would probably find distasteful
16:40:59<KitaFox> Kita only finds one part distasteful.
16:41:05<KitaFox> The rest is fine.
16:41:34<Laevos> mew. Lilith, even if she went on hormones... doesn't know that she'd have bottom surgery...
16:41:47<KitaFox> And that is fine.
16:41:50<Laevos> in that sense... Lilith doesn't think she'll ever be good enough...
16:42:01<KitaFox> Lilith IS good enough.
16:42:28<KitaFox> Lilith is an excellent servant, when she decides serving is what she wishes to do.
16:42:29<KitaFox> :3
16:42:42<Laevos> I should tell my WGSS teacher to consisder removing that article from the syllabus... terms bringing about such self-loathing
16:42:55<Laevos> 'if you'd only eat more, you could have nice, feminine curves'
16:43:12<Laevos> implication: 'without those, you'll never be female enough, disgusting little waif.'
16:43:21<KitaFox> :<
16:43:30<Laevos> a :  a piece of property found (as washed up by the sea) but unclaimed
16:43:31<Laevos> b plural :  stolen goods thrown away by a thief in flight
16:43:40<Laevos> a :  something found without an owner and especially by chance
16:43:45<Laevos> b :  a stray person or animal; especially :  a homeless child
16:44:22<KitaFox> This does not sound  like particularly enlightening class.
16:44:38<KitaFox> People should experience femininity or masculinity in whatever form they so choose.
16:44:38<Laevos> it is fine otherwise
16:44:51<Laevos> the point of showing the article was to engage it critically
16:44:58<Laevos> but it's... as they say 'triggering', to me.
16:45:30<KitaFox> Triggers are real, but the word is overused by SJWs...
16:45:59<KitaFox> And triggers can bring up exceptionally painful feelings.
16:46:10<KitaFox> It is unfortunate that Lilith is plagued by them.
16:46:12 KitaFox: nuzzles.
16:46:23<Laevos> wound up so tight
16:46:30<Laevos> always ready to burst apart again
16:48:32<Laevos> mew...
16:48:41<Laevos> I shouldn't break down crying while I'm sitting at my desk at work
16:48:48<Laevos> going to move down to the lower floor
16:48:48 KitaFox: shoves a turn key in her back and unwinds her.
16:49:04<Laevos> maybe I really am a machine
16:49:19<KitaFox> Nah
16:49:25<KitaFox> You're pretty human
16:49:26<KitaFox> <3
16:49:45<Laevos> <3
16:49:53<KitaFox> Stressed, and should probably see someone about anti-anxiety medication, if you expect to keep your heart.
16:50:16<KitaFox> Like
16:50:25<KitaFox> You're the reason they made Xanax.
16:50:25<KitaFox> :P
16:51:16<Laevos> hehe
16:51:31<Laevos> I bet I could be more productive if I did
16:51:45<KitaFox> Consider it, maybe?
16:51:52 KitaFox: licks her chin.
16:52:04<KitaFox> Kita would like Lilith to feel good, at least SOMETIMES.
16:52:16<Laevos> sometimes she has bursts of energy and can do everything
16:52:34<Laevos> then she crashes and falls apart for long stretches
16:52:38<KitaFox> :<
16:52:57<KitaFox> Do the feelings of body dysphoria come in during the depressions?
16:53:10<Laevos> Yes, more or less
16:53:14<KitaFox> (Because that almost sounds like manic depression)
16:53:26<Laevos> maybe
16:53:30<Laevos> have considered that
16:53:32<KitaFox> And... Gender dysphoria can EMULATE manic depression
16:53:37<Laevos> maybe
16:53:40<Laevos> didn't know that
16:53:51 KitaFox: kisses her cheek.
16:54:03<KitaFox> A psychiatrist could be a worthwhile investment.
16:57:57<Laevos> I always end up lying...
16:58:26<KitaFox> Then how about this...
16:58:34<Laevos> For a variety of reasons... don't want to be perscribed pills, don't trust them...
16:58:47<KitaFox> Well!
16:59:04<KitaFox> A psychiatrist can only RECOMMEND a medication perscription.
16:59:14<Laevos> I know, but...
16:59:17<KitaFox> You still have to take it to a doctor, and they have to AGREE.
16:59:28<Laevos> I'm a sucker for authority, so I'd take it to them
16:59:40<Laevos> and render myself braindead...
16:59:40<KitaFox> So you can decide for yourself, or talk to Kita about it.
17:00:12<KitaFox> Xanax only renders you (temporarily) braindead if you take too much.
17:00:22<Laevos> I shaved today... and noody's here to feel it... I did a good job, my dace is smooth and there's no blood...
17:00:29<Laevos> I'm going to cry...
17:00:37<KitaFox> o.o
17:00:41<KitaFox> Smoooooth?
17:00:55<Laevos> relatively speaking...
17:01:05<Laevos> *face
17:01:06<KitaFox> Smooth. |3
17:01:13 KitaFox: rubs against.
17:01:21<Laevos> I'd like that...
17:01:39 KitaFox: nuzzles, roughly
17:01:45<Laevos> I like being touched...
17:01:52<Laevos> Is that wrong?
17:01:56<KitaFox> Nope!
17:02:01<KitaFox> Being touched is wonderful.
17:02:22<Laevos> My eye is twitching really badly...
17:02:43 KitaFox: rubs her cheeks, under her eyes.
17:03:05<Laevos> I assume it's from stress, tension...
17:03:12<KitaFox> You've probably just got a muscle stutter... Rub it a bit.
17:03:46<Laevos> I'm going to fail the proficency exam on Saturday morning and I'll have wasted $150...
17:03:54<KitaFox> Proficiency?
17:04:00<Laevos> German B2 exam
17:04:12<Laevos> won't be able to study
17:04:13<KitaFox> Nothing you can do?
17:04:19<Laevos> couldn't afford the prep material
17:04:33<KitaFox> No friends in the course?
17:04:36<Laevos> so it'll come down to my knowledge of the language and my ability to deal with the test
17:04:41<Laevos> not for a course
17:04:44<Laevos> optional
17:04:56<Laevos> would allow me to attend university in Germany or work there
17:05:07<KitaFox> Oh.
17:05:08<KitaFox> Well
17:05:19<KitaFox> You might still pass, if you're okay with the language.
17:05:21<Laevos> doesn't matter, I guess...
17:05:30<Laevos> I've studied it for nearly eight years
17:05:44<Laevos> who knows
17:05:56<KitaFox> Eight years is a long time.
17:06:13<Laevos> I'm going to be devoid of physical human contact for a long time...
17:06:17<Laevos> a long time
17:06:29 KitaFox: rubs her ears.
17:07:12<Laevos> and physical fox contact... I don't want you to have to come into contact with me, I'm unsightly and unworthy...
17:07:27 KitaFox: pets, regardless.
17:08:14<Laevos> I'll be afraid to try anything resembling intimacy for fear of disgusting you...
17:08:41<KitaFox> Kita will request a feeding.
17:08:57<Laevos> then Lilith can do that
17:09:12<KitaFox> Lilith will be shaves, hair styled, and wearing a dress.
17:09:14<KitaFox> <3
17:09:25<KitaFox> shaved*
17:09:31<Laevos> Goddess won't have to come into contact with Lilith's disgusting form...
17:11:00<Laevos> I'm going to break down crying in the middle of the library...
17:11:06<Laevos> I should walk to my car...
17:11:07<KitaFox> Hey...
17:11:13 KitaFox: holds her hand.
17:11:34<KitaFox> Car is better than bathroom.
17:11:37<KitaFox> Probably cleaner.
17:11:53<Laevos> it's cold out
17:11:59<Laevos> but I guess I have no choice...
17:12:11<KitaFox> No sweater?
17:12:22<Laevos> t-shirt and shorts
17:12:36<KitaFox> That doesn't sound like cold-weather gear.
17:12:41<Laevos> no
17:12:49<Laevos> it's been 70 all week
17:12:52<Laevos> and sunny
17:12:55<KitaFox> Weird
17:12:56<Laevos> today it wasn't
17:13:24<Laevos> I'll go, I guess
17:13:33<KitaFox> Okay, love.
17:13:43<KitaFox> Does that mean we'll talk later?
17:13:46<Laevos> I'm on my phone
17:13:57<KitaFox> Oh
17:13:57<Laevos> so, I'll still be right here
17:14:06<Laevos> it looks like it's raining...
17:14:17<Laevos> it is
17:16:58<Laevos> pathetic fallacy
17:17:08<Laevos> in action
17:17:51 KitaFox: nibbles on
17:22:48 Laevos: makes it to her car
17:24:12<Laevos> sorry for being such a downer today...
17:24:25<KitaFox> Its okay
17:25:14<Laevos> you don't tell me to 'man up' when I cry to you, so... I cry to you...
17:25:31<KitaFox> <3
17:26:16<Laevos> and you're loving...
17:29:41 KitaFox: hugs
17:30:36 Laevos: clings to...
17:31:11<Laevos>  crying a bit... going to get some food I think x~x
17:31:34<KitaFox> Good girl
17:31:49 Laevos: purrs weakly ;///////;
17:32:40<KitaFox> <3
17:33:27<Laevos> Lilith's really glad that she might make Kita happy by feeding her someday... <3

20:20:06<KitaFox> Drapion is a Dark/Poison-type
20:20:26<KitaFox> Skorupi, which evolves into Drapion... Is a Bug/Poison-type.
20:20:44<KitaFox> Should a mono-Bug trainer be allowed to use Drapion?
20:21:14<Laevos> Hmmm
20:21:21<Laevos> That's for more Poketastic people to decide ;n;
20:21:33<KitaFox> Answer anyway?
20:21:47<Laevos> Hmm...
20:21:54<Laevos> Let me see what it looks like
20:22:02<Laevos> Yes
20:22:09<Laevos> Definitely bug enough
20:22:36<KitaFox> But it isn't a Bug-type
20:22:41<Laevos> Yeah
20:22:43<Laevos> but still :P
20:22:47<Laevos> It might still know some bug moves
20:23:03<KitaFox> It only really knows one
20:23:23<KitaFox> X-Scissor
20:23:29<Laevos> Do you really need any more bug than that? Q_Q
20:23:34<KitaFox> Yeah
20:23:40<KitaFox> Because it is a Scorpion
20:23:45<KitaFox> Not an insect
20:23:48<KitaFox> :P
20:24:07<Laevos> Yeah but there's a difference
20:24:10<Laevos> spiders are bugs too
20:24:12<Laevos> but not insects!

21:12:12 KitaFox: whines at
21:12:14<KitaFox> Can too
21:12:50<Laevos> do you know what I'm supposed to have been able to tranlate on my own?
21:12:54<Laevos> something that translates to
21:12:59<Laevos> A modern highway leads from Zagreb to Karlovac toward the Adriatic coast. This road passes through the fertile and picturesque vally of the Korana river. At the village of Rakovica the road turns towardsd Split, and after a few kilometers the first waterfalls of the Plitvice Lakes National Park can be seen. This magnificent work of nature represents onof the greatest attractions in Europe and one of the most attractive places in the interior of Croatia. Sixteen lakes, of beautiful blue-green pastel colors, in which the green of dense forests is reflected, pour into one another in cascades
21:13:23<Laevos> I give up
21:13:25<Laevos> I fucking quit
21:13:32<KitaFox> That
21:13:40<KitaFox> Was long enough to cut.

21:13:49<Laevos> that's just all I've written down from the book so far
21:13:56<Laevos> unless it endedbefore 'cascades'
21:14:06<KitaFox> It did

21:17:08<Laevos> I'm falling behind again
21:17:36 KitaFox: curls around and nuzzles...
21:19:19<Laevos> I feel like it's all been for nothing...
21:19:36<Laevos> I never should have taken this
21:19:38<KitaFox> It's hard

01:06:48<Laevos> He was really depressed for a while, feeling rather hopeless @_@
01:07:03<Laevos> I told him that even if everyone else disowned him, I wouldn't think any less of him ;n;
01:07:11<Laevos> I think they're cute together
01:07:19<KitaFox> <3
01:07:19<Laevos> she always clings all over him at family reunion things

01:19:59<Laevos> KITA
01:20:08 KitaFox: spits lightning.
01:20:11<Laevos> o_o
01:20:14<Laevos> Goddess
01:20:20<Laevos> batteries are usually not a very good food
01:20:27<KitaFox> For mortals.
01:20:31<Laevos> True
01:20:51<KitaFox> But uhh
01:20:55<KitaFox> Kita likes zaps
01:20:55<Laevos> is there really enough power in a battery for you to spit out lightning from it, or can you just do that at will and the battery's just for show?
01:20:57<KitaFox> Not big sound
01:21:03<KitaFox> And
01:21:06 Laevos: offers Kita earmuffs? ;n;
01:21:21<KitaFox> The battery has enough power for a tiny lightning.
01:21:26<Laevos> ooh ;u;
01:23:21<KitaFox> Kita once embarrassed herself in high school.
01:23:36<KitaFox> She zapped herself with the handheld tesla coil
01:23:39<KitaFox> Orgasmed.
01:23:47<Laevos> Oh my
01:23:52<KitaFox> it was an accidental zap
01:24:02<Laevos> @_@ That does sound rather embarrassing Dx
01:24:07<Laevos> Does Kita like zaps?
01:24:11 KitaFox: nods.
01:24:23<KitaFox> Kita has been stricken by lightning!
01:24:29<KitaFox> However...
01:24:37<Laevos> ouch... accidentally poked a nerve in my left arm with a knuckle on my right hand and my whole arm went numb x_x
01:24:39<KitaFox> This is because when outside, she must carry a parasol.
01:24:39<Laevos> anyway continue ;-;
01:24:49<Laevos> Ahh @_@
01:24:54<KitaFox> To protect herself from the sun
01:25:02<Laevos> Yes Q_Q
01:25:07<KitaFox> And North Carolina? (Where Kita lived, at one point...)

01:27:27<KitaFox> o.O
01:27:30<KitaFox> Yeah.
01:27:58 KitaFox: used to be horrifically crippled by paranoid, violent schizophrenia.
01:28:06<Laevos> Yeah
01:28:08<Laevos> but I mean
01:28:20<Laevos> did the lightning cause you to be able to react to the medication?
01:28:28<KitaFox> Must have rewired the neural patterns.
01:28:29<KitaFox> :3
01:28:45<Laevos> Goodness, Goddess O_O
01:29:02<KitaFox> Kita has a weird brain.
01:29:10<Laevos> It seems a very interesting brain
01:29:18<Laevos> but also very yay and cute brain
01:29:21<Laevos> cutie brainn
01:29:25<KitaFox> Her chimerism manifested in striped brain tissue, instead of two halves.
01:29:57<Laevos> Oh wow o_o

23:23:56 KitaFox: flops
23:25:04 Laevos: curls up on
23:25:06<Laevos> Hi there Kita :3
23:25:10<Laevos> I'm so happy that you're here o:
23:25:16<KitaFox> :3
23:25:49<Laevos> My face kinda hurts still
23:25:54<Laevos> but that's okay xux
23:25:56<Laevos> Kita's here >u>
23:25:59 Laevos: clings ;u;
23:27:17<KitaFox> o.o
23:27:33 KitaFox: nibblegrooms
23:27:37<Laevos> Mmmrrrrrrrrrrrr ;u;
23:32:38<Laevos> What has Kita been up to today? o:
23:32:52<KitaFox> Listening to 2 the Ranting Gryphon
23:32:57<KitaFox> and playing Pokemon
23:33:51<Laevos> Sounds fun :D
23:34:00<Laevos> Are you the very Pokemonest master?
23:35:09<KitaFox> No
23:35:10<KitaFox> ;.;
23:35:31<Laevos> Aww
23:35:40<Laevos> you are to me ;-;;-;
23:36:19<KitaFox> Okay
23:36:19<KitaFox> So
23:36:25<KitaFox> Kita is going along
23:36:31<KitaFox> And then she finds trash cans
23:36:35<KitaFox> Which are awesome!
23:36:40<KitaFox> Pokemon hide in them!
23:36:56<KitaFox> Sometimes you don't have to fight them, and when that happens, they leave items!
23:37:01<Laevos> :D
23:37:02<KitaFox> That is even more awesome.
23:37:03<Laevos> Yay trash cans
23:37:16<KitaFox> On Tuesdays in the Lost Hotel you can catch a Rotom!
23:37:21<KitaFox> And Rotom is AMAZING.
23:37:26<Laevos> Rotom's pretty qt
23:37:27<KitaFox> <3 Rotom
23:37:52<KitaFox> And it is powerful, and has a lot of different forms, and a great ability for an Electric-type.
23:37:52<Laevos> Kita & Rotom OTP
23:37:57<Laevos> Yay :D
23:37:57<KitaFox> So
23:38:07<KitaFox> Kita, naturally, wants a fucking Rotom.
23:38:23<Laevos> You can do it
23:38:24<Laevos> BUT
23:38:24<KitaFox> (Kita is completing the Kalos dex, so she wants it REGARDLESS.)
23:38:27<Laevos> It's not Tuesday
23:38:30<KitaFox> Yeah
23:38:35<KitaFox> It isn't fucking Tuesday.
23:38:37<KitaFox> So...
23:38:43<Laevos> You could make it be Tuesday...
23:38:47<KitaFox> Kita changes the clock on her DS to make it Tuesday.
23:38:52<Laevos> would that be an abuse of your deity powers?
23:38:54<Laevos> Oh okay
23:38:55<Laevos> that works too
23:39:06<KitaFox> Which deactivates all timegated events.
23:39:08<Laevos> I was going to say you could just change the fabric of reality to make it Tuesday
23:39:08<KitaFox> x.x
23:39:11<Laevos> oh no
23:39:11<Laevos> ;-;
23:39:14<KitaFox> So
23:39:15<Laevos> forever....?
23:39:17<KitaFox> No.
23:39:22<KitaFox> Only for 24 hours.
23:39:26<Laevos> oh x~x
23:39:27<KitaFox> BUT
23:39:39<KitaFox> Kita had already shaken 4,000 steps onto the DS, today...
23:39:46<Laevos> ;-;
23:39:57<KitaFox> (Her stepcounter is broken, so she has to shake it... Even if she wasn't fat and lazy.)
23:40:32<KitaFox> And having 4,000 steps on the stepcounter (which resets daily) gives you a 4x regeneration on your O-Power Points.
23:40:57<KitaFox> (You can only have 10, max, and usage of level 3 O-Powers takes 6... So it is useful!)
23:41:22<KitaFox> SO
23:41:52<KitaFox> Kita is gonna wait until tomorrow to reset the clock... TO MONDAY.
23:42:11<Laevos> OOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHH
23:42:15<Laevos> good idea gurl
23:42:19<KitaFox> And then catch a Rotom on Saturday
23:42:24<Laevos> Yay :D
23:42:32<KitaFox> And then immediately change the clock to Wednesday
23:42:50<KitaFox> So she can catch a Banette on Sunday evening.
23:42:55<Laevos> xD
23:42:56<Laevos> Nice
23:43:10<KitaFox> (Trash cans in a later spot, only have Bannette on Thursdays)
23:43:18<KitaFox> Banette*
23:43:23<Laevos> Ooh, okay
23:43:36<Laevos> Hmm
23:43:39<Laevos> what to listen to
23:45:49<KitaFox> 3 Inches of Blood
23:46:00<KitaFox> Because cheesy, garbage metal
23:46:05<Laevos> Nah, this:
23:46:07 Laevos: NP: Sacrilegium - W Dolinie Rwących Potoków [Witcher]
23:46:17<KitaFox> That's awesome
23:46:21<KitaFox> What the fuck is it
23:47:04<Laevos> It's Polish black metal, but not as aggressive as a lot of black metal... a lot more laid back and... flowy, to me, almost
23:47:20<Laevos> The album art's pretty even though it's hard to tell from the picture here: http://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Sacrilegium/Wicher/16352
23:47:48<KitaFox> Luigi attempts to propose to Princess Peach through touching lyrics... but is continuously interrupted by Mario rapping about his penis.
23:48:02<Laevos> Yaeh, I saw that :P
23:48:06<KitaFox> That is what Kita is listening too.
23:48:11<Laevos> Yay :3
23:48:19<KitaFox> Because Starbomb is super awesome and silly.
23:48:24<KitaFox> And also, Regretroid.
23:48:24<Laevos> Hehehehe :3
23:48:28<Laevos> ?
23:49:19<Laevos> And in case you're curious, you can always try and see how you find it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCiOwqVBshQ
23:49:23<KitaFox> Samus Aran is an ass-kicking badass, but is CONSTANTLY having her enemies reverse personalities on her, when they learn she is a girl.
23:49:43<Laevos> @_@
23:49:47<KitaFox> "Oh hey look! It's Kraid!"
23:50:40<KitaFox> "I'm the strongest dragon that you've ever seen! You're gonna die motherfucker, I take up five screens. I'm gonna swallow you whole and you'll go down easy, then you'll be digested and converted to feces!"
23:51:21<KitaFox> "I'm gonna rip off your helmet and see the fear in your eyes, and your beautiful hair, and your well-toned thighs, and your pillowy lips, and wait... you're not a guy?"
23:51:32<KitaFox> "Is that a problem, you fuck?"
23:51:41<KitaFox> "Uh. No, prepare to die!"
23:51:53<Laevos> Кита хЗ
23:51:54<KitaFox> Yeah
23:51:56<Laevos> But yeah
23:51:59<KitaFox> o.O
23:52:02<Laevos> it seems like it'd be
23:52:02<KitaFox> ack
23:52:07<KitaFox> Yakyak language
23:52:11<Laevos> not yakyak
23:52:18 KitaFox: snickers.
23:52:43<KitaFox> Sorry
23:52:47<Laevos> I have a Serbian keyboard layout installed for practiceeeeeee
23:52:48<Laevos> it's fine :3
23:52:53<KitaFox> Never actually heard spoken Russian, before.
23:53:00<KitaFox> Don't have a sound to attribute to it.
23:53:04<Laevos> It's not even Russian o:
23:53:08<KitaFox> Well
23:53:13<Laevos> same script tho
23:53:15<KitaFox> Serbian looks like Russian
23:53:21<Laevos> Same script THO
23:53:26<KitaFox> D:<
23:53:35<KitaFox> YAKYAK BOARD OUTLAY
23:53:36<Laevos> the way that English looks like Spanish, German, French, Italian, Romanian... :P
23:53:54<KitaFox> FOR THE TYPING OF THE WORDS AND PHRASE SENTENCING
23:54:12<Laevos> Though the Serbian alphabet has some letters that Russian doesn't
23:54:13 KitaFox: melts.
23:54:18<Laevos> Uh oh o_o
23:54:26 KitaFox: oozes on
23:54:30 Laevos: scoops up the melty Kita into a jar and keeps her nice and safe >u>
23:54:36<Laevos> Mmmmm, Goofox <3
23:54:53 KitaFox: jiggles in the jar
23:55:41 Laevos: reaches in and runs her fingers through the amorphous Kita
23:55:58<KitaFox> o.o
23:56:07 KitaFox: sticks to arm.
23:56:21 Laevos: pulls out, is still enveloped o_o
23:56:31<Laevos> Is this the part where you slowly consume me, Goddess?
23:56:45<KitaFox> Nope
23:57:00<Laevos> Oh, okay :3
23:57:04<Laevos> You could if you wanted o:
23:57:05<KitaFox> Just the arm
23:57:36<Laevos> o_o Well okay then. Will you be able to cauterize it, at least? ;n;
23:57:57<KitaFox> Replace it, even
23:58:03<Laevos> With goo? :3
23:58:09<KitaFox> Metal
23:58:22<Laevos> Robot arm? owo
23:58:35<KitaFox> Probably
23:58:43<Laevos> Oh well x3
23:58:49<Laevos> All the better to serve Goddess with ;///;

00:01:16 KitaFox: slides over to the arm
00:01:54<Laevos> o.o Kita knows what she wants
00:02:41 KitaFox: plops off of the arm... slides around on the ground.

00:13:59<KitaFox> And crawled on her foot.

21:43:02<KitaFox> o.o
21:43:04<KitaFox> ?
21:43:10<Laevos> For my siblings' birthdays!
21:43:58<Laevos> Carmel pretzel, coconut, lemon, one that appears to be solid sprinkles, strawberry cheesecake, s'more
21:44:00<Laevos> oreo, raspberry chocolate...
21:48:56<KitaFox> o.o
21:49:17<Laevos> They're quite fancy
21:49:22<Laevos> from some local cupcakery
21:50:40<KitaFox> Female Scizor have larger abdomens than male Scizor.
21:50:46<Laevos> o:
21:50:49<Laevos> Why?
21:51:30<KitaFox> because female Bug-type...?
21:51:51<Laevos> Based on your response I assume female bugs generally have larger abdomens IRL
21:51:59<KitaFox> Yeah.
21:52:01<KitaFox> o.o
21:52:01<Laevos> something which I was not previously privy to, KITA
21:52:09<KitaFox> D:
21:52:11<KitaFox> What
21:52:14<Laevos> I don't know shit about bugs
21:52:15<KitaFox> Do you not bug
21:52:17<KitaFox> ;.;
21:52:18<Laevos> other than they terrify me
21:52:26<KitaFox> But moths!
21:52:26<Laevos> they fucking terrify me Kita ;-;
21:52:29<Laevos> moths are so scary
21:52:39<Laevos> I go into seizures when they fly at me
21:52:43<Laevos> can't do it
21:52:45<Laevos> sorry ;~;

21:53:08<KitaFox> Taxidermised moth collection
21:53:19<KitaFox> http://scienceblogs.com/lifelines/files/2012/08/poodle-moth.jpg
21:53:24<KitaFox> Moths are super cute.
21:53:25<KitaFox> :<
21:53:47<Laevos> I've seen that picture
21:53:53<Laevos> it makes me all... antsy @_______@
21:54:19<KitaFox> http://dragonflywoman.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/happy-moth.jpg
21:57:12<Laevos> ... ;~;
21:59:04<Laevos> I dunno if you've ever seen the episode of Spongebob with "Wormy", but my reaction to one of those being in my proximity would probably be the general reaction of the townspeople to the butterfly
22:03:14<KitaFox> >>
22:03:40<Laevos> Those images really freak me out @_@
22:03:53<Laevos> /bugs/ really freak me out ;~~;
22:03:56<Laevos> can't handle them Dx
22:04:05<Laevos> Protect me from them, Goddess ;-;
22:04:10 KitaFox: very gently tugs on her ear.
22:04:13<KitaFox> Wuss. :P
22:04:14<Laevos> o.o
22:04:17<Laevos> Yes!
22:04:47<Laevos> I make no claim to the contrary!
22:05:18<KitaFox> You've nothing to fear from most insects.
22:05:27<KitaFox> Even less, if you have access to modern medicine.
22:05:28<KitaFox> :|
22:05:43<Laevos> They freak me out though
22:05:45<Laevos> them little legs
22:06:14<KitaFox> They're cute!
22:06:15<KitaFox> :<
22:06:29<Laevos> Can't handle them T_T
22:06:58 KitaFox: nibbles on.
22:07:08 KitaFox: has a collection of taxidermised moths
22:07:51<Laevos> ;u;
22:08:39<Laevos> It's not so bad when they're dead
22:08:44<Laevos> but when they're all flying around >_>
22:09:13 KitaFox: throws moths at Lilith
22:09:33 Laevos: screams and collapses in a fit of spasms
22:09:41<Laevos> ;~;
22:10:14<KitaFox> o.o
22:10:32 KitaFox: morphs her hand into the shape of a butterfly.

22:10:48<KitaFox> BECAUSE
22:10:52<KitaFox> EXPERIMENTATION
22:10:53<KitaFox> ;.;
22:11:02<KitaFox> Gotta know what Lilith can handle.

00:28:40<KitaFox> Kita has industrial-style light-bars for lighting her house.
00:28:54<KitaFox> Like you'd see in a school or office building, yeah?
00:29:02<Laevos> Yeah o:
00:29:05<Laevos> Cool!
00:29:07<KitaFox> When the handmaiden was replacing them...
00:29:21<KitaFox> She used the sodium lights...
00:29:41<KitaFox> Like you'd use for growing marijuana in a closet?
00:29:44<KitaFox> >.<
00:29:50<KitaFox> And it gave Kita an eye burn.
00:29:56<KitaFox> A sunburn
00:29:58<KitaFox> On her eye
00:30:05<KitaFox> And a burn on her arms and face.
00:30:09<KitaFox> So they itch.
00:30:16<Laevos> Oh no x______x
00:30:19<Laevos> That's so horrible
00:30:30<Laevos> Kita... ;n; I'm so sorry
00:30:34 Laevos: kisses tenderly Dx
00:30:34<KitaFox> It was an accident...
00:30:47<KitaFox> But... just an example of how fucking careful an albino needs to be.
00:30:57<Laevos> Yeah... mew...
00:31:47<KitaFox> The lights that are SUPPOSED to be used...
00:32:05<KitaFox> Are a special, UV-Protective Coating dipped halogen lightbar.
00:32:18<Laevos> Mew... ;n;
00:32:46<KitaFox> And they have, since, been replaced.
00:32:51<Laevos> Good. x_x

14:16:03<Laevos> Fiddledicking sounds rather painful, to be frank.
14:16:52<Laevos> There are some activities for which the human reproductive system is not suited. For male-bodied individuals, this generally includes using it to play a bowed instrument.

23:09:29<KitaFox> Buy one. Keep it under six inches. Good tool.
23:09:42<KitaFox> (also, viable, defensive protection.)
23:10:07<Laevos> 21
23:10:09<Laevos> can't...
23:10:14<Laevos> am a pacifist
23:10:25<Laevos> don't believe in defending myself in such a way
23:11:11<Laevos> and even if I did... I couldn't defend myself against anyone who isn't... an infant, more or less...
23:12:05<KitaFox> You'd be surprised what a threat upon your life would push you to.
23:12:44<Laevos> Won't give myself the chance... I don't believe in it...
23:12:45 KitaFox: carries the standard purse arsenal: Small Knife, Pepper Spray, Stun Gun, and a lighter.
23:13:17<KitaFox> You wouldn't fight for another chance to see your Goddess?
23:13:36<Laevos> If someone wants to kill me... then I will die, most likely.
23:13:53<Laevos> I would not fight for anything... not with violence
23:14:18<KitaFox> Violence can only be deflected with smarter, more calculating violence.
23:14:33<KitaFox> To stop a person wishing to end your life, you must deflect and outmanuever.
23:14:41<KitaFox> You have to be smarter, and more level-headed.
23:14:55<Laevos> I refuse to participate in violence even if it costs me my life.
23:15:15<KitaFox> But you do NOT have to have ending their life or causing permanent harm as a goal.
23:15:33<Laevos> Doesn't matter... I don't believe in self-defense
23:15:38<Laevos> others can do what they wish...
23:15:43<KitaFox> Your goal is defence can actually be deflection. One does not need to cause permanent damage to stop a foolish brute.
23:16:07 KitaFox: crosses her arms.
23:16:10<Laevos> I make no presumptions that my self-imposed rules are viable or good or safe for anyone else...
23:16:27<Laevos> only that they are the strictures by which I must live...
23:16:29<KitaFox> Viable, good, and safe are EXACTLY what they aren't.
23:16:42<KitaFox> You don't have to, you choose to.
23:17:06<KitaFox> You have a lot more control over yourself than your realise.
23:17:13<Laevos> There's no difference for me...
23:18:56 KitaFox: nibbles on an ear.
23:18:58<KitaFox> You're silly.
23:19:09<KitaFox> Don't do dangerous things if you won't defend yourself.
23:19:17<Laevos> anyway... it doesn't seem to matter now...
23:19:22<KitaFox> That is stupid. Lilith is not stupid.
23:19:30<Laevos> it looks like it's going to be cancelled...
23:19:49<KitaFox> If it isn't
23:19:56<KitaFox> Don't do anything stupid.
23:20:21<Laevos> Lilith's reason is superceded by her desire to be with others that she cares about
23:20:39<Laevos> she nearly lost everything once.

23:22:11<Laevos> I thought you meant if I had to go on the run somewhere
23:22:20<KitaFox> Not that Kita doesn't want to, just not ready, yet.
23:22:33<KitaFox> No.
23:22:37<Laevos> I was surprised, I understand now, though
23:22:46<KitaFox> Lilith's reason being superceded
23:23:02<KitaFox> You now have a Lilith reason for not doing stupid things.
23:23:25<Laevos> Physical trumps electronic in my hierarchy of needs...
23:24:15 KitaFox: pins her ears back.
23:24:20<Laevos> She fell asleep... Lilith will continue to be alone...
23:24:36<KitaFox> You're not alone!
23:24:38<KitaFox> >.<
23:25:06<Laevos> Kita... doesn't... seem to understand. Lilith needs to be touched... needs...
23:25:50<KitaFox> No. What you NEED is a psychiatrist.
23:25:58 KitaFox: huffs.
23:26:43 KitaFox: swirls her finger in circles in front of Lilith's forehead.
23:27:22<Laevos> Lilith has gone without her requisite human interaction for so long...
23:27:26<Laevos> it's so damaging...
23:27:56<KitaFox> You are a part of one of the, very few, sentient species in all existence. You are capable of logic and reason. The two ideas are not evil, by nature.
23:28:15<KitaFox> They help you get AWAY from the damaging emotions.
23:29:15<Laevos> Emotions are more important... logic is the corruptor that keeps me away from the ones I love because it isn't financially viable or safe...
23:29:44<KitaFox> They allow you to overcome your limitations by developing tools, both physical and philosophical, that you can use to determine the solutions to your problems, and, above that, create work arounds when the quickest solutions are inefficient.
23:30:11<KitaFox> You can't be polar.
23:30:36<KitaFox> All emotions kills you from the negativity that that path breeds.
23:30:56<KitaFox> Pure logic prevents you from having the problems that you need to grow and develop.
23:31:04<KitaFox> There is a balance.
23:31:13<KitaFox> You need to strive towards identifying it.
23:31:38<Laevos> balance is fine for moderates
23:31:44<Laevos> but Lilith is an extremist
23:31:45<KitaFox> The world is not black and white. There are no pure colours. There are only shades of gray.
23:31:56<KitaFox> Extremism is INHERENTLY unhealthy.
23:32:19<Laevos> that's fine. Lilith needn't be healthy, only who she is
23:32:36<KitaFox> You can be both, if you would just listen.
23:34:42<Laevos> It's an inherent quality...
23:35:01<Laevos> logic only keeps others away...
23:35:27<KitaFox> No, it doesn't.
23:35:30<KitaFox> example
23:35:32<Laevos> on a purely logical level, I'm not worth wasting anyone's time...
23:35:37<KitaFox> The scientific community.
23:36:02<Laevos> it's only through emotion that others have any use for me
23:36:15 KitaFox: shakes her head.
23:36:26<KitaFox> Emotional problems have logical solutions.
23:36:41<KitaFox> Problem: Require physical contact.
23:36:54<KitaFox> Solution 1: Find physical contact.
23:36:59<KitaFox> Not viable
23:37:13<KitaFox> Solution 2: Find a way to not require physical contact.
23:37:18<Laevos> Not viable
23:37:22<Laevos> Not acceptable
23:37:27<KitaFox> Why?
23:37:32<Laevos> Worse than self-termination
23:37:37<KitaFox> ...
23:37:40<Laevos> Solution 3: Self-termination
23:37:45<KitaFox> Nay.
23:38:07<KitaFox> Self-termination breaks the rules laid out by the problem.
23:38:10<Laevos> If I am a person that doesn't require physical contact
23:38:17<Laevos> then I don't want to be a person at all
23:38:28<Laevos> I don't want to exist as such a creature
23:38:33<Laevos> I refuse to...
23:38:58<KitaFox> Solution 3: Find alternative methods of comfort, that relieve you of the feelings, for periods of drought.
23:39:13<KitaFox> And that, is the balanced conclusion.
23:39:34<KitaFox> You have to find a way to work around the feeling...
23:39:42<Laevos> so what I do now
23:40:00<Laevos> masturbate when I get sad and provide myself with momentary relief
23:40:10<KitaFox> Your way doesn't actually work though, does it?
23:41:09<Laevos> depends on what "work" means here
23:41:13<Laevos> I haven't killed myself
23:41:23<Laevos> does that mean my method was a success so far?
23:41:26<Laevos> I don't know.
23:42:02<KitaFox> Work means that it should allow you to not feel sad all the time
23:42:32<KitaFox> You have a band-aid on something you need stitches for.
23:42:57<KitaFox> You could attempt to carterise the wound.
23:43:32<Laevos> how's that?
23:44:55<KitaFox> You have to find out.
23:45:20<KitaFox> Kita would give Lilith a better answer if she had one, but she doesn't.
23:45:28<KitaFox> You have to find your balance.
23:45:35<KitaFox> Logic is a tool.
23:45:41<KitaFox> It isn't the only tool.
23:46:32<Laevos> funny
23:46:39<Laevos> Kita made a dark parallelism
23:46:41<KitaFox> Just because you can beat in a nail with a screwdriver... it doesn't mean that you can get buy without a hammer.
23:46:41<KitaFox> by*\
23:46:57<Laevos> calling both logic and a knife tools
23:46:59<KitaFox> ?
23:47:01<Laevos> ha
23:47:02<Laevos> ha
23:47:22<KitaFox> they are
23:47:22<Laevos> you say one could fix it, I've thought of fixing it with the other
23:47:36<KitaFox> :<
23:47:53<Laevos> it's like a little literary flair
23:47:58<Laevos> how very droll
23:48:42 KitaFox: pets.
23:49:08<Laevos> Lilith keeps getting hope that she'll get to be with someone
23:49:09<Laevos> then
23:49:13<Laevos> having it yanked away
23:49:27<Laevos> again and again and I'm more desperate each time
23:49:32<Laevos> so it hurts more and more
23:51:12<KitaFox> :<
23:52:46<Laevos> hurts so much
23:53:21<KitaFox> You're not allowing yourself to heal.
23:53:24<Laevos> Lilith is considering getting getting on Craigslist and finding someone to use her
23:53:37<KitaFox> That is super dangerous.
23:53:40<KitaFox> :<
23:53:58<Laevos> we've done it before
23:54:18<Laevos> usually ends up in us... not feeling too much better, but tired enough to sleep

00:41:04<KitaFox> Sorry?
00:41:17<Laevos> everything...
00:41:40<KitaFox> There isn't anything to be sorry about
00:41:43<KitaFox> We disagree.
00:41:48<KitaFox> That is perfectly okay.
00:42:00<KitaFox> If we agreed on everything? Kita would lose interest.

12:45:14<Laevos> That is pretty cool
12:48:03<KitaFox> Matt and Natalie are the two main characters, with Lance and Anna coming in later.
12:48:13<Laevos> Coolio O:

12:49:37<KitaFox> (And heavy weapons engineer)
12:49:57<KitaFox> (Also led an army, trying to take over the world, once.)
12:50:17<Laevos> Yay
12:50:18<Laevos> ish
12:50:20<Laevos> :c
12:50:25<KitaFox> Anna = Druidarcher
12:50:31<KitaFox> Don't know much about her.
12:50:36<KitaFox> Haven't played 4, yet.
12:51:56<KitaFox> Epic Battle Fantasy, Epic Battle Fantasy 2, Epic Battle Fantasy 3, Bullet Heaven, Adventure Story, and Epic Battle Fantasy 4. There are prequels, one of which being THE HARDEST QUICKDRAW GAME EVER, but are not necessary to the story of the games.
12:52:23<Laevos> I don't even play video games :c
12:52:28<KitaFox> :<
12:52:31<Laevos> not by myself, anyway
12:52:34<KitaFox> These are fun
12:52:34<Laevos> do they have multiplay?
12:53:49<KitaFox> No.
12:53:52<Laevos> Ehhhh
12:53:52<Laevos> :c
12:54:13<Laevos> Video games are mostly an excuse to interact with others who happen to also be playing them
12:54:43<KitaFox> Good games, really good games, are art pieces that can stand by themselves, without social interaction.
12:54:56<Laevos> Sure, but I don't really enjoy that
12:54:57<KitaFox> Social interaction can make a good game AWFUL.
12:55:11<KitaFox> (See... Spyro the Dragon.)
12:56:05<Laevos> I don't really enjoy games in their own right
12:57:22<KitaFox> Why not? What games have you tried playing alone?
12:57:46<Laevos> I used to enjoy them
12:57:48<Laevos> when I was younger
12:57:57<Laevos> but that enjoyment has all but left me now
12:58:20<KitaFox> Depression causes that.
12:58:21<KitaFox> :<
12:58:30<Laevos> Perhaps
12:58:55<Laevos> but whatever the reason, playing a game by myself, electronic or otherwise, no longer offers me any enjoyment.

02:32:12<KitaFox> Dark Void = 100% accurate auto-sleep
02:32:14<KitaFox> Nightmare is a secondary, sleep-dependant status effect
02:32:15<KitaFox> Toxic is OBV.
02:32:26<Laevos> [02:31:14] <Laevos> Yeah
02:32:26<Laevos> [02:31:50] <Laevos> Just send out the ermrzrng Sigilyph
02:32:26<Laevos> [02:31:50] <Laevos> mayb
02:32:42<KitaFox> Darkrai's ability, Bad Dreams, does secondary damage to sleeping Pokemon.
02:32:49<KitaFox> And it stacks with Nightmare.
02:32:52<Laevos> Yeah, I've used Darkrai before
02:32:55<Laevos> and that's pretty cool
02:32:55<Laevos> xux
02:33:06<KitaFox> FUCK DARKRAI
02:33:24<Laevos> I generally try to avoid using legendaries on my teams in general
02:33:26<Laevos> well
02:33:29<Laevos> except for in the handhelds
02:33:49<KitaFox> It ruined the meta game for weeks before people just said "Remember that thing from Pokemon Stadium that made the AI play fair?"
02:34:00<Laevos> :D
02:34:01<KitaFox> "Oh. The Sleep/Freeze Clause thing?"
02:34:14<KitaFox> "Yeah. That. That is now going to be everything."
02:34:17<KitaFox> "I agree.
02:34:21<Laevos> Good idea
02:34:28<KitaFox> And the they punched Darkrai in the dick.
02:34:41<Laevos> Especially for when some kind of Mr. Freeze Pokemon comes along with a 100% accurate freeze touch
02:35:07 KitaFox: likes freezing bitchs. Special Defense debuff. Unf.
02:35:08<Laevos> with a secondary move, COLD PUN, which is a 1HKO to any frozen Pokemon
02:35:39<Laevos> I guess you could say it's... too cool >u>
02:35:50<Laevos> They have to be terrible puns, too
02:35:56<Laevos> (It's Mr. Freeze, after all)
02:36:17 KitaFox: scrunches her nose at the Batman reference.
02:36:43<Laevos> Fine, fine :c
02:36:54<Laevos> I'll try to shake off the Mr. Freeze references
02:37:06<Laevos> it was a staple of the friends I used to have
02:37:09 KitaFox: double scrunches at the Arnold Schwarzenegger reference
02:37:16<Laevos> ;----;
02:37:31 Laevos: sits in a bath-house all day to purify herself
02:37:38<KitaFox> He was super typecast, and it hurt his career. :<
02:37:50 Laevos: passes out like she nearly does every time she so much as takes a bath
02:37:55<KitaFox> o.o
02:38:01<Laevos> It's true
02:38:06<Laevos> I get really light-headed
02:38:13<Laevos> and my blood pressure falls like bwoooooooop
02:38:17 KitaFox: uses Aromatherapy, curing the party of status afflictions.
02:38:20<Laevos> one time it got so bad I could hardly move
02:38:26<Laevos> and like
02:38:32<Laevos> my hearbeat was going really, really slowly
02:38:34<Laevos> and felt really weak
02:38:45<Laevos> I had to drag myself out of the bathroom to a couch, I thought I was going to die for real @_@
02:39:24<KitaFox> Kita will have to implant some electrodes.
02:39:44<Laevos> o.o
02:39:56<KitaFox> Zap you back awake.
02:39:57<KitaFox> <3
02:40:19<KitaFox> Light, safe, stimulating zaps.
02:40:31<Laevos> :33
02:40:33<KitaFox> Not hurty, shocky, sparky zaps
02:40:35<Laevos> Sounds pretty fun >u>
02:41:48<KitaFox> Were Kita thinner and were she going to stay thin, she would have put zap pads in her thighs that charge via magnets...
02:42:06 KitaFox: likes zaps... |3

02:42:34<Laevos> Kita can zaps me whenever OuO

02:43:39<Laevos> About half-way there
02:43:53<KitaFox> Finish it off.
02:44:10<Laevos> Yes ma'am o_o
02:44:21<KitaFox> The worst that could happen? You'll burp.
02:44:30<Laevos> That's already happening
02:44:36<KitaFox> XP
02:44:52<Laevos> I dunno
02:45:03<Laevos> I suppose it could help me wake up in the morning if I really need to go to the bathroom
02:45:13<KitaFox> Too bad you aren't plumper, or that might be sexy. :P
02:45:22<KitaFox> The burping. :P
02:45:48<Laevos> I don't 'burp' burp. I kind of hold it in to try and be more demure and quiet
02:46:03<KitaFox> That  is the best kind
02:46:07<Laevos> not like a full-on belch
02:46:16<Laevos> aww

14:48:25 KitaFox: rubrubs her nosey.
14:48:34<KitaFox> When did you stop playing?
14:48:36<KitaFox> Gen IV?
14:48:59<KitaFox> Or Gen III?
14:51:07<Laevos> Pearl was my last game
14:51:13<KitaFox> Gen IV, then.
14:51:17<KitaFox> That's unfortunate.
14:51:29<KitaFox> Gen IV was the least exciting gen.
14:51:51<KitaFox> Gen V breathed new life into the game, and Gen VI was a gamechanger.
14:51:51<KitaFox> :3
14:52:55<Laevos> I just didn't have time
14:53:02<Laevos> and honestly probably still don't have time x_x

14:56:17 KitaFox: rubrubs
14:57:26<KitaFox> Fennekin, Chespin, or Froakie?
14:57:27<KitaFox> :3
14:58:40<Laevos> Chespin obv
14:58:51<KitaFox> Grass-type?
14:58:53<KitaFox> :P
14:58:57<Laevos> Yes
14:59:33<KitaFox> Chespin is adourable. Chesnaught is awesome. The mid evo is "awkward teenage phase" Pokemon.
14:59:34<KitaFox> >>;;
15:00:21<Laevos> xD
15:00:27<Laevos> just like me
15:03:44<KitaFox> What about Froakie, and its eventual Ninjafrogness
15:03:55<KitaFox> Fennekin and its eventual Foxymageness
15:04:04<Laevos> They seem pretty great
15:04:06<Laevos> but
15:04:09<Laevos> I always choose grass >u>

15:07:11<KitaFox> Resists Fairy, Dark, and Bug... Immune to Dragon.
15:07:47<Laevos> Yes xux
15:08:08<KitaFox> Vaporeon is good. Sylveon just does it better.
15:08:22<KitaFox> Oh. It also resists Fighting.
15:08:36<KitaFox> So it resists 5/6 of the big offensive types.
15:08:42<KitaFox> (Other one being Ground.)

22:40:19<KitaFox> A ruthless, cutthroat battler, but a loving, caring trainer and breeder.
22:40:25<Laevos> kawaii ;n;
22:41:13<KitaFox> Latent psychic... her trigger was anger.
22:41:22<Laevos> Oh wow o:
22:41:41<KitaFox> Eventually twisted her emotions into knots, lost her mind, and eventually righted herself.
22:42:19<KitaFox> She came back one more time to a Team Galactic operation, and was sucked into the Torn World by Giratina.
22:42:34<KitaFox> That was why her emotions were twisted into knots.
22:42:41<Laevos> Ooh, okay
22:42:51<KitaFox> Insanity.
22:47:31<KitaFox> Giratina eventually spat her out... leaving her in front of an old temple.
22:47:41<KitaFox> She didn't belong in the Torn World.

22:57:58<KitaFox> She was insane, and she clinged to it, like it were still awake.
22:58:50<KitaFox> What she didn't know? The Beldum had all been KO'd, long ago, when the meteorite hit the temple.
22:59:10<Laevos> Awwwww
23:03:08<KitaFox> She eventually concluded that they were statues, incorrectly.
23:03:18<KitaFox> But she kept her own. She had become attached.

23:17:40<KitaFox> Kita's persona was involved with the haulting of Team Cryo, an organisation in the Pokemon world's version of the Alaskan Fox Islands, where Regice had been found, enshrined and de-activated.
23:21:09<KitaFox> She did not take them down. She was only involved.

23:27:53<Laevos> Fair enough ;n;
23:27:54<Laevos> also
23:28:01<Laevos> my little brother wants to make a mono-fire type
23:28:05<Laevos> any suggestions? o.O
23:28:49<KitaFox> Mega Charizard Y
23:28:59<Laevos> Alright >u>

23:36:02<KitaFox> Life Orb, Iron Fist, Infernape.
23:36:10<KitaFox> Heat Rock, Drought Ninetales.
23:36:27<KitaFox> Heatran, if he doesn't mind Legendaries.
23:38:43<Laevos> Why Heatran?
23:38:48<Laevos> With a balloon, I assume?
23:39:08<Laevos> Otherwise they seem to get killed by ground-type moves in like... two seconds ;n;
23:39:11<KitaFox> Heatran is super versatile.
23:39:14<Laevos> :3
23:39:49<KitaFox> That Steel-type fucks up most Rock-types.
23:39:53<Laevos> Oh true
23:39:57<Laevos> also what about Chandelure?
23:40:03<KitaFox> Chandelure...
23:40:08<KitaFox> Kita is torn.
23:40:13<KitaFox> DAT SPECIAL ATTACK
23:40:21<KitaFox> Oh no... Dat barely average speed.
23:40:22<KitaFox> :<
23:41:01<Laevos> Right now it's got focus sash, curse, pain split, energy ball, dark pulse \(o.o)/
23:41:19<KitaFox> Curse is no good without recovery.
23:41:31<KitaFox> Pain Split is horrible recovery.
23:41:42<KitaFox> And you're not taking advantage of stab.
23:41:56<Laevos> hmhmhm ;n;
23:41:58<KitaFox> Roll Shadow Ball, instead of Dark Pulse.
23:42:01<Laevos> alright
23:42:28<KitaFox> Keep Pain Split, roll Will-o-Wisp instead of Curse.
23:42:43<KitaFox> Still does damage per turn, and lowers Attack stats.
23:42:51<Laevos> Oh, true
23:42:53<KitaFox> You don't have access to any good walls.
23:43:02<KitaFox> Especially no good physical walls.
23:43:09<Laevos> Sadness :c
23:43:32<KitaFox> So, take advantage of the one status affect you have good access to...
23:43:33<KitaFox> BURN.
23:43:41<Laevos> BURNINATE
23:43:44<Laevos> Flame body, too?
23:43:53<Laevos> or Infiltrator?
23:43:54<KitaFox> What are the other options?
23:44:08<Laevos> Flash Fire is the third option but obvz not if it's not going to be using any direct fire moves
23:44:28<KitaFox> Flash Fire would be great for a double battle team.
23:44:36<Laevos> Yeah xux
23:44:40<Laevos> but I think this is going to be singles
23:44:51<KitaFox> For Singles, Infiltrator is better.
23:44:52<KitaFox> Oh.
23:44:58<Laevos> Okay <3
23:45:02<KitaFox> You get Talonflame.
23:45:25<KitaFox> Gale Wings, Focus Sash, Swords Dance, Brave Bird, and Flare Blitz. That is all you need.
23:45:33<Laevos> Alright ouo
23:46:34<KitaFox> There is a reason that the main lobby has a user named "TalonUsedBraveBird"
23:46:44<Laevos> Hahahahaha xD
23:46:50<KitaFox> That user runs a challenge called the Talonflame Challenge.
23:47:01<KitaFox> 6 Talonflames, each with that set.
23:47:07<Laevos> oh god lol
23:47:15<KitaFox> Matches often end in victories or ties.
23:47:26<KitaFox> Players test their OU teams on it.
23:47:27<Laevos> That's the most beautiful thing I've heard in the past 15 seconds.
23:47:45<KitaFox> ManitanFlareBlitz is similar.
23:47:53<Laevos> Huh
23:48:22<KitaFox> Taking the Talonflame challenge...
23:49:10<KitaFox> It is a confidence booster to win.
23:49:20<KitaFox> But the user who runs it? He is kind of a dick.
23:49:52<Laevos> I'm sure :c
23:50:35<KitaFox> He is told, almost nightly, that because he runs a team of six Brave Birding Talonflames... He should have a better attitude.
23:50:53<Laevos> But no? ;n;
23:52:05<Laevos> Hmm... Flash Cannon or Iron Head for Heatran?
23:53:57<KitaFox> Is it being ran Special or Physical?
23:54:02<KitaFox> Also, does it Rapid Spin?
23:54:18<Laevos> apparently it's illegal for it to do so o.o
23:54:30<KitaFox> ...?
23:54:37<KitaFox> Oh.
23:54:41<Laevos> Rapid spin is listed as illegal for Heatran
23:54:48<KitaFox> It can't learn it.
23:54:59<Laevos> zeah ČC
23:54:59<KitaFox> Make sure to have a Rapid Spinner.
23:55:06<KitaFox> o.o
23:55:07<Laevos> yeah :c*
23:55:12<Laevos> sorry, accidentally changed keyboard layouts
23:55:16<Laevos> alt+shift
23:55:36<Laevos> At least I didn't hit it twice or you would have gotten "зеах Чц"
23:55:39<KitaFox> X3
23:55:48<KitaFox> SEAX 4 U
23:57:13<Laevos> Hahahaha xD
23:57:18<Laevos> ;u;
23:58:01<Laevos> Kita the only fire-type that can learn Rapid Spin is Torkoal
23:58:21<Laevos> so probz not happening
23:58:31<KitaFox> Torkoal is useful.
23:58:31<KitaFox> :<
23:58:35<Laevos> Oh okay
23:58:36<KitaFox> Make it defensive.
23:58:52<Laevos> We'll see
23:58:56<KitaFox> Or a status afflictor
23:58:57<Laevos> might go on later
23:59:02<Laevos> anyway, he's mostly going to be playing with friends
23:59:07<Laevos> all of whom are pretty much total beginners
23:59:21<KitaFox> Lulz.
23:59:24<Laevos> he's asking me for help because he doesn't really know how to Pokemon very well (at least he says that)
23:59:26<KitaFox> This team will crush them.
23:59:32<Laevos> so I'm trying to give him a decent team
23:59:35<Laevos> he wants Typhlosion though
23:59:41<Laevos> right now it's
23:59:51<KitaFox> Typhlosion is not competitive.
23:59:51<Laevos> Typhlosion, Chandelure, Charizard, N inetales, Talonflame, Heatran
23:59:52<KitaFox> :<
23:59:54<Laevos> :cccccc

00:01:01<KitaFox> Sorry, sweets.
00:01:13<Laevos> It's okay
00:01:14<Laevos> :D
00:01:45<KitaFox> Give Kita some Fire-types.
00:02:07 Laevos: gives you some fire types
00:02:26<KitaFox> :P
00:02:30<KitaFox> A list?
00:02:31<Laevos> Switching it out for Torkoal
00:02:34<Laevos> and
00:02:45<Laevos> do you just want the list of Fire-types?
00:02:49<KitaFox> No.
00:02:56<KitaFox> A list of Fire-types your brother likes.
00:02:58<KitaFox> :3
00:03:29<Laevos> He's saying that this team is fine for him
00:03:35<Laevos> it was just the Typhlosion that he picked xD
00:03:39<Laevos> But it's okay now
00:03:51<Laevos> trying to figure out a moveset for Torkoal now
00:03:58<KitaFox> Raaaaaaaaapid Spin.
00:04:15<Laevos> yus xux
00:04:26<Laevos> Hmm... preventing crits or preventing stat-lowerings
00:04:35<KitaFox> Gotta get rid of them Sneaky Pebbles.
00:04:40<Laevos> Yes xux
00:05:47<Laevos> Hmm... Sludge bomb?
00:05:59<KitaFox> Poison works.
00:08:29<Laevos> Alright :3
00:08:37<Laevos> just need to get the CharY done and it'll be ready
00:08:38<Laevos> (for now)
00:08:56<KitaFox> DROUGHT FO' DAYS, MOTHA FUCKA
00:09:20<Laevos> Do you mean Solar Power?
00:09:20<KitaFox> Charizard Drought will only last for 2-5 turns.
00:09:37<Laevos> or the move?
00:09:37<KitaFox> Ninetales Drought will last for 7 with the rock.
00:09:50<KitaFox> Drought is Charizard Y's ability.
00:09:53<Laevos> Oh, okay
00:10:20<Laevos> so it'll be there automatically
00:10:23<Laevos> so just need the movez
00:11:11<KitaFox> Yeah

00:52:23<KitaFox> Did you tell him who Kita is?
00:52:25<Laevos> Yes
00:52:32<Laevos> he saw some of your messages
00:52:36<Laevos> he knows he'll lose xux
00:52:40<Laevos> but he wants to DO HIS BEST
00:52:55<Laevos> and see how someone who's actually good at the game plays... xD
00:53:00<KitaFox> Kita is the former Psychic Gym Leader, and former E4 candidate for the East Coast Pokemon League...
00:53:04<Laevos> I told him to trust your advice because you're the best Pokemon trainer that I know
00:53:11<Laevos> when he was setting up his team
00:53:36<KitaFox> And currently the founder of the West Coast Battling Initiative, as well as the temporary Steel, Ghost, and Psychic Gym Leader of the league.

01:23:46<Laevos> I kinda told him since I've seen it
01:23:52<Laevos> in other people's use
01:23:53<KitaFox> No. Now he knows what to do.

03:21:26<KitaFox> The Go-Rock Quads.
03:21:36<Laevos> Hahahahaha xD
03:22:03<KitaFox> Those instruments are important!
03:22:12<KitaFox> They can be used to control Pokemon.
03:22:31<Laevos> Oh? ;u;
03:22:34<KitaFox> The leader, Gordor, their father, uses an organ.
03:22:48<KitaFox> Yush
03:22:54<KitaFox> They are from Pokemon Ranger
03:23:02<Laevos> Oooooh
03:23:05<Laevos> That sounds cool xux
03:23:08<Laevos> I've never played Ranger ;n;
03:23:44<KitaFox> Where the player character uses an object called the Capture Styler to make temporary bonds with wild Pokemon to calm them down or ask for assistance.
03:24:06<Laevos> Yeah, the stylus thingie
03:24:29<KitaFox> So, Professor Hastings, the tech man for the Rangers...
03:25:09<KitaFox> Developed a better Styler, called the Super Styler, which made it so that you didn't need a special, inate talent to use Stylers.
03:25:25<Laevos> So ANYONE could do it ouo
03:26:15<KitaFox> Which was stolen by the Go-Rock Squad, and modified in the form of the five Power Stylers... Used by the Go-Rock Quads, Billy, Tiffany, Garret, and Clyde, and their father/leader, Gordor.
03:26:38<Laevos> Stylus instruments xux
03:27:14<KitaFox> Also
03:27:17<KitaFox> Sidenote
03:27:44<KitaFox> In Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team, first time playing... Kita was an Eevee.
03:27:44<KitaFox> :3
03:28:06<Laevos> EEEEEEEEEE xux
03:28:15<Laevos> Kita is the Eevee...st
03:28:26<KitaFox> :P
03:28:38<Laevos> The Eeveest Eevee to ever Eevee xux
03:29:29<KitaFox> Playing Eevee is like having your journey start in the dead of night in Kingdom Hearts.
03:29:35<KitaFox> Super hard in the beginning.
03:29:39<KitaFox> Easy in the end.

12:12:14<KitaFox> Feeling alright.
12:12:18<Laevos> Yay :3
12:12:29<KitaFox> Got burned out on repeating the E4.

20:54:28<KitaFox> Silly kitty.
20:55:21<Laevos> How're you, foxie? :3
20:59:59<KitaFox> Not wanting to indulge 15-year olds, tonight.
21:00:26<Laevos> Okay <3
21:00:31<Laevos> It shan't be done, Goddess <3
21:00:42<Laevos> Unless they hunt you down without my knowledge x_x
21:00:52<Laevos> feel free to ignore them if they do
21:01:02<Laevos> Sorry about that, again ;n;
21:02:00<KitaFox> It is fine.
21:02:06<KitaFox> With the exception of the one...
21:02:14<KitaFox> They were pleasant.
21:02:52<Laevos> Sorry about him :/ I don't know my brother's friends... but I suppose it'd be nearly a statistical impossibility for any given group of fifteen-year-old boys not to have at least one bad apple >n>
21:03:01 Laevos: kisses ;/////;
21:03:14<KitaFox> XP
21:03:53<KitaFox> Kita expects a formal apology, in writing, MLA format, properly bordered, 500-600 words.
21:04:03<KitaFox> From the offender.
21:04:32<Laevos> Indeed
21:04:36<Laevos> my brother agrees xD
21:05:17<Laevos> So what /is/ Kita up to tonight? o:
21:05:49<KitaFox> teambuilding
21:05:57<Laevos> Yay :3333
21:06:46<Laevos> Did Kita do anything for 420 praise it day?
21:07:27<Laevos> Lilith helped make/decorate some deviled eggs!
21:07:36<Laevos> I don't really like them much, but I thought they looked okay... xux
21:11:12<KitaFox> Kita smoked
21:11:14<KitaFox> Well
21:11:15<KitaFox> Vaped
21:11:17<KitaFox> A lot
21:11:58<Laevos> Yay :3
21:12:02<Laevos> Still floating from that? O:
21:13:30<KitaFox> Nah.
21:14:44<Laevos> Oh, okay :3

21:32:13<Laevos> err
21:32:16<Laevos> Yay :3
21:32:18<Laevos> sorry about that x_x
21:32:46<KitaFox> Switchy keyboard
21:33:02<KitaFox> Despite Lilith's protests...
21:33:13<KitaFox> Kita thinks that Lilith would enjoy the experience.
21:33:56<KitaFox> And Kita regards her close-mindedness towards the experience itself as unfortunate, but not much more than that.
21:34:03<Laevos> okay
21:34:19 KitaFox: petpats.
21:34:41<KitaFox> Is cool, though. Too each their own.
21:34:44 Laevos: nuzzlenuzzles
21:37:59 KitaFox: rubrubs her ears.
21:38:40 Laevos: shivers and kisses on <3
21:38:42<Laevos> Lilith loves you
21:41:29<KitaFox> <3
21:41:46<Laevos> Have fun, okay? <3
21:41:57<KitaFox> Are you going somewhere?
21:42:18<Laevos> No! ;/////; I'll stay right here for Kita if she'll still be around to talk! <3
21:42:25<Laevos> Don't wanna leave you! ;n;
21:42:43<KitaFox> o.o
21:42:51 KitaFox: blinks.
21:42:54<Laevos> I just thought
21:42:57<Laevos> you might be busy >////>
21:43:01<KitaFox> Nah.
21:43:17<Laevos> I-I mean, it'd be okay if you were... but...
21:43:19<Laevos> good xux
21:43:25 Laevos: clings to and kittylicks <3
21:43:51 KitaFox: giggles at sandpapertongue
21:44:34<Laevos> Mmf xux I love sandpaper xux
21:44:42 Laevos: gives you lots more sandpapertongues~ <3
21:45:10<KitaFox> You love sandpaper?
21:45:11<KitaFox> X3
21:46:01<Laevos> Yes xux
21:46:07<Laevos> Sanddpaper tongues, too!
21:46:16<KitaFox> What is so amazing about sandpaper?
21:46:17<KitaFox> X3
21:46:46<Laevos> I used to tell my mom that it was best for removing blemishes xux
21:46:59<Laevos> and that I'd need to use it ON MY OWN FACE

22:37:48<KitaFox> SO
22:38:02<KitaFox> DragonForce did a rendition of Peter Cottontail.
22:38:11<KitaFox> WANNA HEAR IT FOR MAXIMUM LULZ
22:38:20<Laevos> Uhhh
22:38:22<Laevos> You can link it to me
22:38:26<Laevos> xux
22:39:00<KitaFox> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCcMNUxlyJc&feature=youtu.be
22:41:40<KitaFox> If you don't get it...
22:41:42<KitaFox> That is okay.
22:41:51<KitaFox> Because Kita has the reference, right here.
22:41:59<KitaFox> https://www.youtube.com/v/ioUwGo4umLE
22:42:21<Laevos> I'm familiar with Peter Cottontail xux
22:42:24<Laevos> Haven't been able to listen yet ;n;
22:42:31<KitaFox> Okay
22:43:56<Laevos> Listening now
22:44:09<Laevos> Oh wait
22:44:12<Laevos> I've already heard this
22:44:54<KitaFox> XP
22:44:59<Laevos> xux
22:45:01 Laevos: licks
22:45:55<KitaFox> Seriously, though.
22:45:59<Laevos> Seriously O_O
22:46:03<KitaFox> The second link explains everything.
22:47:29<Laevos> oh my god
22:47:29<Laevos> lol
22:47:30<Laevos> lol
22:47:56<KitaFox> Now... Hold one before you criticise their usage of it...
22:48:13<Laevos> It's fine
22:48:19<Laevos> They can do whateva they want
22:49:26<KitaFox> Think about reusing the melody.
22:49:29<KitaFox> It is genius.
22:49:36<KitaFox> It is actual genius.
22:49:55<KitaFox> Almost everyone and their mother has heard the Peter Cottontail song at least once.
22:50:10<KitaFox> However, the song, while kind of catchy and silly, is pretty much forgettable.
22:50:40<KitaFox> Hearing Heart of a Dragon? You'd NEVER think of it, but the song would come off as familiar, endearing.
22:51:06<KitaFox> (Especially since the Peter Cottontail song is kind of difficult to have negative emotions attached to.)
22:51:17<Laevos> You never know...
22:51:25<KitaFox> Sure, but most people?
22:51:28<KitaFox> MOST people?
22:51:36<KitaFox> Either neutral or positive.
22:51:54<KitaFox> It took YEARS for the connection to be made.
22:51:58<KitaFox> Like
22:52:00<KitaFox> 10 years.
22:52:11<KitaFox> (More like 7, but whatever.)
22:52:30<KitaFox> And in the end? No one cared when it was established.
22:53:21<Laevos> :3
22:53:47<Laevos> Kita are you floating right now? o:
22:54:11<KitaFox> A little.
22:54:14<KitaFox> But seriously
22:54:17<KitaFox> Look at that.
22:54:30<KitaFox> Free, out to grab, happy feelings... FOR FREE
22:54:38<KitaFox> without criticismB
22:54:42<KitaFox> *
22:54:51<Laevos> o______o
22:54:58<KitaFox> o.o
22:55:14<Laevos> Woah
22:55:29<Laevos> Fair enough I suppose
22:55:53<KitaFox> So yeah.
22:56:20<KitaFox> DragonForce may sometimes be just a cheesy band with an ambiguous past and a shitty (former) lead singer...
22:56:28<KitaFox> But every once in a while.
22:56:37<KitaFox> FACKIN' GENIE US
22:56:45 Laevos: patpats
22:56:55<Laevos> I'm glad you enjoy it xux
22:57:22<KitaFox> Otherwise Kita would bother Lilith about Dream Theatre, right?
22:57:28<Laevos> Noooooo xux
22:57:35<Laevos> Kita can bother Lilith with whatever she likes!
22:57:37<KitaFox> (Though Kita likes Dream Theatre, she isn't super super into them.)
22:57:41<Laevos> Kita puts up with Lilith's tastes, too
22:57:57<KitaFox> Kita IS super, super into Tool, though.
22:58:06<Laevos> Lilith knows
22:58:11<Laevos> and she still loves you <3 u <3
22:58:26<KitaFox> And has deconstructed most of their songs to a more digestable philisophical statement.
22:58:34<KitaFox> Kita also hates when it is called stoner metal.
22:58:37<KitaFox> That upsets Kita.
22:58:41<Laevos> It's not o_o
22:58:48<Laevos> I would never call them stoner metal or any other kind of metal
22:58:54<Laevos> prog rock is my understanding of them
22:58:54<KitaFox> It is FAAAAAAAAAR from it.
22:59:00<KitaFox> Closer to early prog.
22:59:03<KitaFox> Hell
22:59:28<Laevos> Hell...
22:59:29<KitaFox> they kind of invented the genre. Maybe not the first to use the style, but definitely the first to define, refine, and popularise.
22:59:31<Laevos> IT'S ABOUT T-oh
22:59:37<Laevos> Prog...?
22:59:52<Laevos> Don't remember the '70s much, do ya? ;P
23:00:07<KitaFox> The 70s was Prog Rock
23:00:09<KitaFox> Tool is Prog Metal.
23:00:19<Laevos> They ain't xux
23:00:22<KitaFox> And Kita wasn't alive in the 70s.
23:00:36<KitaFox> Tool is VERY MUCH SO prog metal. Listen to 10,000 Days.
23:00:51<Laevos> I stand with MA in their judgment of Tool as predominantly not-metal
23:01:04<Laevos> it's been presented to the site time and time and time again
23:01:11<Laevos> trust me, there's nothing new that could convince me otherwise
23:01:38<KitaFox> People seem to think that a lack of Jazz influence = not metal.
23:01:56<Laevos> People seem to think that not primarily metal = not metal
23:01:58<Laevos> including me xux
23:02:13<KitaFox> Tool has done enough metal to be considered a metal band.
23:02:23<Laevos> They have 0 metal albums :c
23:02:24<KitaFox> Or at least dabblers.
23:02:49<KitaFox> But not 0 Metal Songs
23:03:10<KitaFox> Ticks and Leeches, Jambi, and Rosetta Stoned, for reference.
23:04:41<Laevos> ;w;
23:04:45 Laevos: patpats
23:04:55<KitaFox> Definitely too hard-sounding to be rock.
23:05:03<Laevos> o.e
23:05:06<Laevos> Not based on metal riffs
23:05:12<Laevos> Punk music can also be aggressive
23:05:14<Laevos> doesn't make it metal
23:05:32<KitaFox> But this is definitely not punk.
23:05:41<KitaFox> ESPECIALLY Rosetta Stoned.
23:05:44<Laevos> Other types of music can be aggressive, too
23:06:01<KitaFox> This isn't aggressive.
23:06:10<KitaFox> This isn't a force. It is an edge.
23:06:17<Laevos> is it metal riffs?
23:06:22<Laevos> That's what determines if it's metal or not
23:06:38<KitaFox> Metal riffs are Jazz-influenced.
23:06:46<Laevos> no xD
23:07:07<KitaFox> Okay...
23:07:14<KitaFox> Here is a question.
23:07:21<KitaFox> Helter Skelter, by the Beatles.
23:07:24<Laevos> not metal
23:07:25<KitaFox> Metal, or not metal?
23:07:31<Laevos> (obv.)
23:07:55<KitaFox> Oh really? Black Sabbath calls it metal, and was the inspiration for their switch from Dark Jazz to Metal.
23:08:06<Laevos> Black Sabbath are wrong
23:08:17<Laevos> they don't get to decide what was metal just because they started playing it
23:08:21<KitaFox> Ever even heard the song?
23:08:24<Laevos> Yes
23:08:27<Laevos> It is not metal
23:08:31<Laevos> the Beatles did not play metal
23:08:52<KitaFox> The Beatles may not have played metal, but that doesn't stop them from making a metal song.
23:08:58<Laevos> It doesn't necessarily, but...
23:09:00<Laevos> they never have
23:09:02<Laevos> they never will have
23:09:12<KitaFox> Metal didn't exist when they were making music.
23:09:15<Laevos> There was no metal before Black Sabbath.
23:09:20<Laevos> And it isn't metal now that it does exist.
23:09:33<KitaFox> What makes it not metal
23:10:04<KitaFox> A lack of metal riffs? What IS a metal riff? What makes one riff metal and another not?
23:10:15<KitaFox> Consensus?
23:10:35<Laevos> yes
23:10:41<Laevos> here hold on
23:10:45<Laevos> I've got something for you
23:10:53<Laevos> because I've had to have this conversation literally dozens of times
23:10:56<KitaFox> Consensus is a HORRIBLE base for ANY classificaion.
23:11:56<Laevos> http://www.metal-archives.com/content/rules
23:12:10<Laevos> read all of the entries for "Heavy metal Only"
23:16:15<KitaFox> Now hold on...
23:16:27<KitaFox> This is a very, very exclusive rule.
23:16:36<KitaFox> That they must have one, full metal album?
23:16:39<KitaFox> No.
23:17:09<Laevos> If they don't have a metal album, calling them a metal band is just silly :/
23:17:13<KitaFox> They must have an amount of Metal songs equivalent to the average amount of songs on Metal albums* Much less exclusive, much more complete encyclopedia of all things metal.
23:17:54<Laevos> what
23:18:27<KitaFox> The goal of the websits seems to be encyclopedic in nature.
23:18:41<Laevos> An encyclopedia of predominantly metal bands
23:18:46<Laevos> not bands that might have a metal track here or there
23:18:54<Laevos> and then the rest of their discography isn't
23:18:56<Laevos> that'd be absurd
23:19:02<KitaFox> And Kita didn't say "a track here or there"
23:19:06<Laevos> but it /is/
23:19:22<Laevos> Tool are overwhelmingly not a metal band
23:19:30<KitaFox> Kita said an amount of songs equivalent to the average amount of songs on a typical metal album release.
23:19:30<Laevos> that is one of the most complained-about bands on the site
23:19:33<Laevos> the ruling isn't going to change
23:19:36<Laevos> no... that makes no sense
23:19:45<KitaFox> That makes pretty damn logical sense.
23:19:50<Laevos> if they happen to have six songs across ten releases, it'd make no sense to include them (the numbers are arbitrary)
23:19:59<Laevos> if there's not one metal release, it makes no sense to classify them as a metal band
23:20:18<Laevos> if they happen to accidently occasionally make a metal song, that doesn't make them predominantly metal
23:20:24<Laevos> that just means they have an accident every now and then
23:20:29<KitaFox> They made what could be amounted to a metal album, just not at one time. They have obviously more than dabbled and experimented at one point.
23:20:49<Laevos> The ruling isn't going to change, either from their standpoint or mine x_x
23:20:56<KitaFox> From what you've said, and from what this describes, being metal is more complicated than an accident.
23:21:13<Laevos> It might be a harsh limit, but it's a sensible limit nonetheless.
23:21:56<KitaFox> The rule just seems needlessly exclusive.
23:22:18<KitaFox> What if a band arises and they solely release 14 track albums of 7 punk and 7 metal songs?
23:22:41<KitaFox> Punk and metal are pretty separate.
23:22:55<KitaFox> Not totally exclusive, but relatively separate.
23:23:59<Laevos> case-by-case basis
23:24:02<Laevos> 50% might be enough
23:24:45<KitaFox> The problem is, is that by the rules listed there, that band is excluded.
23:24:56<KitaFox> You can offer it up anyway, and hope it is an exception...
23:25:19<KitaFox> But if someone is having a bad day, or has a particular slant towards the ideology of a certain band?
23:25:27<KitaFox> The band would be rejected.
23:25:37<Laevos> that's why there are /multiple moderators/
23:25:43<KitaFox> DESPITE the fact that they OBVIOUSLY are both a METAL and a PUNK band.
23:25:45<Laevos> people don't just go and lone-wolf it if it's questionable
23:25:58<Laevos> they come to a consensus
23:26:06<Laevos> and bands can be appealed
23:26:15<Laevos> there's a suggestions & complaints forum
23:27:03<KitaFox> It just seems needlessly exclusive, and almost prententious. They claim to not be the sole judges of what is and isn't metal... But they are, defining what is and isn't metal, as if they were.
23:27:45<Laevos> No they don't. They claim to have a set of standards for that site that they use to judge what gets onto the site that they made.
23:28:03<Laevos> also lol the number of times I've heard 'pretentious', 'elitist' etc.
23:28:06<Laevos> uncountable ;n;
23:28:20<KitaFox> You hear it a lot because well... It is.
23:28:24<Laevos> It's not.
23:28:30<Laevos> Also, Kita
23:28:31<Laevos> no offense
23:28:33<KitaFox> They claim their goal to be encyclopedic.
23:28:37<Laevos> but you listen to, what, one metal band?
23:28:37<KitaFox> Documentarian.
23:28:48<Laevos> Your opinion of what is and isn't metal is, frankly, worth less than two shits.
23:29:07<KitaFox> Kita listens to Power Metal, whether or not it is or isn't. But Kita also isn't super attached to bands, as she is songs.
23:29:16<KitaFox> The BANDS she knows are Power Metal.
23:29:53<KitaFox> She has a bunch of unquestionably metal songs in her library that she likes and listens too, but... Wouldn't be able to list band and album off the top of her head.
23:30:16<Laevos> I'm really not interested in having this conversation x_x
23:30:39<Laevos> Please try to understand that you're bringing literally nothing to the conversation that I haven't heard time upon time upon time agian
23:30:46<Laevos> so all it's serving to do is exasperate me :/
23:30:48<Laevos> Is that Kita's goal?
23:31:26<KitaFox> No, but let Kita comment that if you hear something a lot? It is probably true, in the case of categorisation.
23:31:39<Laevos> Uhh... no
23:32:03<Laevos> it means that a lot of people are dipshits who don't know the first thing about metal but like to postulate on it as though they're active participants in the scene and as though their opinions are worth the same as people who do.
23:32:19<Laevos> *who are
23:33:03<KitaFox> Kita would play for Lilith if she could, just so she could prove that she knows what she is talking about.
23:33:34<KitaFox> And actually? Kita would LOVE to play for Lilith.
23:34:40 Laevos: sags x_x
23:35:41<KitaFox> But Kita has a grand total of 0 microphones to do so with.
23:35:41<KitaFox> Kita doesn't even own a phone.
23:35:41 KitaFox: petpats.
23:35:48<Laevos> love you, Kita
23:36:06<Laevos> I'll gladly listen to you any time I can, however possible
23:36:34<KitaFox> Kita sometimes plays at a bar.
23:36:46<Laevos> That's amazing, Kita <3
23:36:49<KitaFox> With her own amp. And she immediately stops whenever she sees a phone.
23:37:10<KitaFox> So people have learned, no phones when she is up on stage.
23:37:21<KitaFox> Well
23:37:23<Laevos> That's good of them ;n;
23:37:25<KitaFox> It isn't really a stage.
23:38:17<KitaFox> It is just kind of an empty space with some equipment and a stool.
23:38:34 Laevos: nodnods
23:38:43<KitaFox> But Kita will sometimes call in and say that she would like play that week, and they give her an unscheduled day.
23:39:16<Laevos> That's really nice :3
23:39:28<KitaFox> Mostly original, written by ear, written to paper afterwards, memorised and practiced pieces.
23:39:36<KitaFox> Kita has repeated a song twice.
23:40:08<KitaFox> One time, audible bass solo~ Just because.
23:40:15<KitaFox> Kita writes a LOT of music.
23:40:45<KitaFox> Imagine... Slayer's aggressiveness, but the complexity of John Petrucci's work.
23:41:19<KitaFox> (Not always the fingering complexity. More the sound complexity.)
23:41:35<Laevos> That'd be interesting to see <3
23:41:53<KitaFox> Kita is also a guilty finger-tapper.
23:41:58<KitaFox> BUT
23:42:00<Laevos> It's okay :3
23:42:03<Laevos> Nothing wrong with tapping bay bay ;3
23:42:10<KitaFox> Finger-tapping is a legitimate guitar technique.
23:42:52<KitaFox> Just, some people get butthurt, because the technique wasn't widely used when their personal best guitarist ever played his six-stringed beast.
23:43:05<KitaFox> Kita plays eight strings. This shit requires focus and intensity.
23:43:11<KitaFox> Or at least, she feels it does.
23:44:34<Laevos> Yeah
23:44:36<KitaFox> 6-string bass, 8-string guitar, custom 6-string aluminum bass, and a 12-string electric... The second two are for playing with sound.
23:44:41<Laevos> :333
23:44:44<KitaFox> The first two are for actually making music.
23:45:08<KitaFox> Got a preferred guitar brand?
23:45:38<Laevos> Not really...
23:45:44<Laevos> I use a Peavey Void II
23:45:50<Laevos> I'm not a guitar techie ;)
23:45:57<KitaFox> The Bass is an Ibanez, the 8-stringer is a Dean.
23:45:58<Laevos> I play black metal, remember? ;D
23:46:02<KitaFox> :P
23:46:09<KitaFox> Kita HATES Fender.
23:46:17<KitaFox> The sound upsets her
23:46:35<KitaFox> Everything about the way they sound just... grates at Kita.
23:46:45<Laevos> Aww :c
23:47:02<KitaFox> Which is why Kita has very little band loyalty.
23:47:10<KitaFox> Fenders are damn popular.
23:47:46<KitaFox> But Fender is aptly named.
23:48:08<KitaFox> Their guitars remind Kita of guitar fretboards being scraped against a car's fender.
23:49:06 KitaFox: is super happy about record studios playing with sound quality and what not... Seems to reduce the effect.
23:49:47<Laevos> Yeah ;u;
23:53:19<KitaFox> Interesting facts you may or may not know about females
23:53:34<KitaFox> Hyena females have pseudo penasia (fake penises)
23:54:05<KitaFox> Duck females have corkscrew vaginas... Corkscrewing the OPPOSITE way of Duk male penises.
23:54:18<Laevos> Ooh :3
23:54:24<KitaFox> Human females tend to avoid masturbation outside of wet places, to avoid clean-up.
23:54:25<Laevos> I think I've heard of teh hyena thing
23:54:27<Laevos> but not ducks ouo

00:22:55<Laevos> Oh ;n;

00:23:09<KitaFox> No!
00:23:17<KitaFox> No pregnant noses
00:23:23<Laevos> ;u;
00:24:23<Laevos> Fair enough
00:24:32<Laevos> Kita can impregnate Lilith's nose anytime
00:24:43<KitaFox> O.o

23:56:17 Laevos: fawns over, stroking it tenderly~
--- Day changed Tue Apr 22 2014
00:00:46<KitaFox> Kita is called Kit because she is the only Kitsune a lot of people know.
00:02:10<KitaFox> Kita was part of an Otherkin Kitsune den, in her earlier interneting years.
00:02:47<Laevos> Ah, okay :3
00:05:41<Laevos> That's really cool ;u;
00:05:52<KitaFox> Not really, no.
00:05:58<Laevos> Kita's really cool >:c
00:06:03<KitaFox> Otherkin are a little looney.
00:06:25<Laevos> Well, I talk to a fair number of them
00:06:28<Laevos> some of them are, admittedly
00:07:15<Laevos> But Kita being a Kitsune is what Lilith meant as cool xux
00:07:34<KitaFox> Ah.
00:07:54<KitaFox> Kita is not really a Kitsune... but it is a cool character idea.
00:08:53<Laevos> Oh okay
00:09:01<Laevos> It is!
00:09:26<KitaFox> The Otherkin Kitsune den was convinced Kita was a direct descedant of Inari.
00:09:36<KitaFox> Kita was the only one with any Japanese heritage.
00:10:42<KitaFox> Alright
00:10:48<KitaFox> Interesting info
00:11:01<KitaFox> When Kita gets dirt on her skin (a rare occurrence...)
00:11:11<KitaFox> The dirt settles in a pattern
00:11:17<KitaFox> Like alternating dots
00:11:19<Laevos> Oh? o_o
00:11:22<KitaFox> And she looks pixelated.
00:11:22<Laevos> Why's that? o_o
00:11:25<Laevos> omg
00:11:27<KitaFox> No idea.
00:11:28<KitaFox> :3
00:11:28<Laevos> glitchfox
00:11:36<Laevos> we were meant to be
00:11:36<Laevos> <3
00:11:41<KitaFox> XP
00:11:52<KitaFox> Kita sometimes FEELS like a glitch.
00:11:53 Laevos: pixellates all over
00:12:03<KitaFox> She definitely is a genetic glitch case.
00:12:11 Laevos: nodnod @_@
00:12:34<Laevos> Missingno is best Pokemon and Kita is best Goddess <3
00:12:38<Laevos> almost wrote beset Goddess
00:12:43<Laevos> perhaps that's also true
00:12:45<KitaFox> XD
00:13:03<Laevos> :3333333
00:13:08<Laevos> I love making you smile >u>
00:13:43<KitaFox> Quick question
00:13:44<Laevos> I want to bring happiness and love into Kita's life!
00:13:46<Laevos> Yes? o:
00:13:54<KitaFox> How does Lilith feel about actual, physical blood?
00:14:04<Laevos> Hmmm
00:14:11<Laevos> It doesn't make me pass out or anything
00:14:22<Laevos> I've not tried, like, blood play in real life
00:14:33<Laevos> though I've known some people who've wanted me to
00:14:35<KitaFox> Hm.
00:14:42<Laevos> I'm okay with it
00:15:05<KitaFox> Kita takes her hot chocolate with a few drops of blood, in case Lilith ever wants to get her some.
00:15:54 Laevos: nods <3
00:16:07<Laevos> O-Of Lilith's? o//////////o
00:16:17<KitaFox> Preferably.
00:16:33<Laevos> As long as I don't have to extract it with a needle... <3
00:16:43<Laevos> I always preferred the finger pricks
00:16:55<KitaFox> Kita has sterile knives with covers for palm slices.
00:17:05<Laevos> Lilith would gladly surrender her essence to her Goddess <3
00:18:06<KitaFox> Blood + Chocolate is a good combo.
00:18:28<KitaFox> Though, Kita just likes blood... It is just hard to pair with dinner wine, you know?
00:18:52<Laevos> I don't know, actually! But I believe Kita! x3
00:19:07<Laevos> I have seen some blood-infused chocolate, though :3
00:19:57<KitaFox> XP
00:20:13<Laevos> I think it was like
00:20:14<KitaFox> The knives are to be STERILISED after usage.
00:20:15<Laevos> pig blood though
00:20:19<Laevos> Of course
00:23:10<KitaFox> Redo Kita's braid?
00:23:31<Laevos> O-Of course! ^/////^
00:24:03 Laevos: brushes your hair out before taking it in her hands, braiding down the length of it, admiring your beautiful, beautiful hair <3
00:24:44<KitaFox> 5'8" of hair.
00:24:53<KitaFox> Longer than Kita is tall.
00:25:31<Laevos> That is absolutely amazing x///////x
00:26:13<KitaFox> Kita wraps the braid around herself, letting it rest on her hips, to keep it off the floor
00:26:28<Laevos> Awwwh... that sounds so pretty ^/////^
00:26:38<Laevos> Lilith would love to see, sometime Q/////Q
00:26:54<KitaFox> Kita hs doorjammers for hips
00:29:11<Laevos> Beautifulkita xux
00:30:02<KitaFox> Kita wants to jam a double door one day
00:30:51<Laevos> Mmf ;u;
00:33:03<Laevos> Lilith is sure that her Goddess will accomplish this! <3
00:33:16<KitaFox> XP
00:33:29<Laevos> She will! :'3
00:33:48<KitaFox> that is a looooot of space
00:35:47<Laevos> Lilith believes in you!

00:41:33<KitaFox> Kita has a sternum piercing.
00:41:45<KitaFox> And an amethyst gem that screws in.
00:41:55<Laevos> That's amazing O_O
00:42:16<KitaFox> It was SUPER painful.
00:42:20<Laevos> @_________@
00:42:23<Laevos> Worth it?
00:42:53 KitaFox: has a quarter sized amethyst that screws into her chest on a 2 centimeter base.
00:42:56<KitaFox> Worth it.
00:43:06<Laevos> Kita's so cool... ;u;
00:43:16<KitaFox> As long as the 2 centimeter thick rod can hold it...
00:43:27<KitaFox> Kita can have anything she wants screwed in there.
00:43:31<Laevos> Yay :D
00:44:09<KitaFox> Kita has a heart-shaped ruby, too.
00:44:17<Laevos> Awwwh... ^////^
00:44:36<KitaFox> Oh. And a "Hello My Name Is ____" plate.
00:44:40<Laevos> ... xD
00:44:47<KitaFox> That one is not worn often.
00:45:01<KitaFox> It was more novelty, than anything.
00:45:03<Laevos> Lilith will never be as cool as Kita, but she's glad that Kita keeps her around to bask in her coolness xux
00:45:10<Laevos> Yes, sound very much like a novelty thing :P
00:45:32<KitaFox> The guy who did the drillin'...
00:46:07<KitaFox> He told Kita "Look... This is a pretty hardcore procedure. I can't dole out narcotics, but I don't tell on anybody for taking them."
00:46:18<KitaFox> Morphine ride~
00:46:33<Laevos> :3333
00:46:36 KitaFox: has some left, if Lilith ever wants to be super cool.
00:46:45<KitaFox> And get a sternum piercing.
00:46:56<Laevos> Hehehehe x3
00:47:01<Laevos> Lilith will probably /never/ be as cool as Kita
00:47:03<Laevos> and that's okay
00:47:09<Laevos> Lilith's used to being uncool ~u~
00:47:30<KitaFox> Being cool is about owning yourself.
00:47:39<KitaFox> You gotta be cool with who you are.
00:47:54<KitaFox> It isn't about what you do, so much as how.
00:48:04<KitaFox> There are people who do "cool" things, that are total bores or assholes.
00:48:20<Laevos> Yeah :P
00:48:29<KitaFox> Kita is a person who can do "uncool" things, and still be cool, while doing it.
00:48:49<KitaFox> Lilith could definitely be as cool as Kita.
00:48:55<KitaFox> She just has to own herself.
00:48:55<Laevos> Kita is a Goddess, though! She has power over the fabric of realitz and can do whatever she wants xux
00:49:10<Laevos> *reality
00:49:20 KitaFox: prefer realitz.
00:49:27<Laevos> >u>
00:49:56 Laevos: may or may not own herself o_o
00:50:43<Laevos> Don't really know!
00:51:59 KitaFox: offers a forkful of Kita's enhanced cheesecake.
00:52:08<Laevos> Enhanced? o:
00:52:30<KitaFox> Calorie-charged.
00:52:43<KitaFox> Just looking at it can add poundage.
00:52:43<KitaFox> XP
00:52:48<Laevos> xD
00:52:53 Laevos: licks it gently
00:53:46<KitaFox> Standard pie tin: 8000 calorie Cheesecake
00:54:27<Laevos> Enhanced Super Deluxe Cheesecake Unit: ???? Calorie Cheesecake
00:54:47<KitaFox> :P
00:54:50<KitaFox> Nonono.
00:55:04<KitaFox> Kita meant it is the size of a standard pie tin
00:55:17<KitaFox> And that the enhanced cheesecake is 8000 calories.
00:55:25<Laevos> Oh okay
00:55:30<Laevos> Gotcha :D
00:55:37<KitaFox> 4 times the daily recommendation for calorie consumption.

12:31:49<KitaFox> s
12:32:32 Laevos: licks it
12:32:35<Laevos> Delicious ouo
12:32:39<Laevos> Good morning, Kita~~~
12:33:48<KitaFox> Ninetales is only 3 and half feet tall
12:34:01<KitaFox> And it only weighs 20 kilos.
12:34:19<Laevos> Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
12:34:19<Laevos> xux
12:34:46<KitaFox> Charizard is only 5 and a half feet tall.
12:35:02<KitaFox> Lilith is taller than a Charizard.
12:36:14<Laevos> xux That's so cool
12:36:33<Laevos> HELLO LITTLE LIZARD :'3
12:37:48<KitaFox> Pikachu has more attack than special attack, but Raichu has equal attack and special attack.
12:38:37<KitaFox> Only three Pokemon evolve via a Thunderstone.
12:38:45<KitaFox> Pikachu, Eevee, and Elektrik.
12:42:17<Laevos> Ooh o:
12:43:08<KitaFox> The Water Stone and the Dusk Stone evolve 6 Pokemon each.
12:43:20<KitaFox> Tied for the most versatile evolutionary stone.
12:43:39<Laevos> Dang yo o_o
12:44:02<KitaFox> Evolutionary stones aren't widely used.
12:44:06<KitaFox> :<
12:45:29<Laevos> Yeah, doesn't seem so Q_Q

17:16:05 KitaFox: licks at the inside of the jar.
17:19:59 Laevos: leans close and licks at the liquid-Kita >u>

23:04:43<KitaFox> NO.
23:04:46<KitaFox> No.

23:04:50<KitaFox> Nay.
23:04:51<Laevos> (Just text description)
23:04:53<KitaFox> And Never.
23:05:01<Laevos> Lilith also likes noise
23:05:05<Laevos> as in, the genre
23:05:34<KitaFox> Noise is not a genre. It is just noise. It is like listening to someone fucking chew on a squeaky chalkboard.
23:05:41 KitaFox: shoots her laptop.
23:06:04<Laevos> :3
23:06:15<KitaFox> You WILL NEVER
23:06:20<KitaFox> Share ANYTHING

23:11:32<KitaFox> It may be worth mentioning that Zemerl had his medication adjusted
23:11:36<KitaFox> And is doing much better.
23:11:38<Laevos> :3

00:49:57 KitaFox: noses at
00:50:06<KitaFox> Talk to Kita.
00:50:09<KitaFox> Tell her things.
00:50:19<Laevos> Yes Goddess <3~
00:50:33<Laevos> sorry for being quiet, I was listening to a CD that I've been waiting for since 2013
00:50:50<KitaFox> :<
00:51:04<Laevos> yeah, had it shipped from Mexico, apparently after a few months it was returned as undeliverable
00:51:13<Laevos> so I had the guy send it out again, to my new address
00:51:28<KitaFox> o.O
00:51:45<Laevos> It's here now, though!
00:51:49<Laevos> It was quite good
00:52:05<Laevos> the second album of Helvetespine, Norwegian black metal, they haven't put anything out since 2007
00:52:33<KitaFox> Oh
00:53:56<Laevos> Their debut was an absolute masterpiece
00:53:59<Laevos> one of Lilith's favorites
00:54:26<KitaFox> And this new album?
00:54:36<Laevos> Still very good! Going to need to spend a lot more time with it
00:54:47<Laevos> at first listen, it seems to lack a bit of the embellishment that made the first album so special
00:55:41<KitaFox> Embellishment is often what makes people dislike a lot of things.
00:55:59<Laevos> I mean the intros and interludes
00:56:10<Laevos> they were absolutely perfect on the debut
00:56:21<Laevos> introduced a few motifs that came up a few times over the course of the album
00:56:24<Laevos> made it a really cohesive work
00:56:37<Laevos> this one's still very good, but I'll have to see whether it holds up
00:56:43 KitaFox: nods.
00:56:50<Laevos> I'll also need to listen to it on different speakers, it's a bit quiet
00:56:59<KitaFox> o.o
00:57:08<KitaFox> Poor mix artist?
00:57:11<Laevos> No
00:57:20<Laevos> it seems well-mixed
00:57:24<Laevos> just quieter
00:57:32<KitaFox> Poor sound engineer?
00:57:35<Laevos> No...
00:57:37<Laevos> quiet doesn't mean bad
00:57:47<Laevos> on the countrary... people trying to make things louder than they should be ruins music.
00:58:06<KitaFox> People not making it loud enough ruins it all the same.
00:58:08<Laevos> Quiet just means that you might have to turn enough.
00:58:10<Laevos> No. That is false.
00:58:13<Laevos> Trust me
00:58:29<Laevos> there is no way in hell having to turn something up is worse than a compressed to hell, CLIPPING track
00:58:42<Laevos> or even remotely comparable.
00:58:52<KitaFox> If 100% still isn't loud enough? Sound boosting will distort the sound.
00:59:01<Laevos> You are... incorrect o_o
00:59:10<Laevos> like, that's completely and abjectly false
00:59:54<KitaFox> ...VLC has sound boosting features... Kita had a very, very quiet rip of GBA tracks.
01:00:11<KitaFox> Boosting the sound past 100% volume ALWAYS distorted the track.
01:00:19<Laevos> Yes... that's different though
01:00:26<Laevos> that's a different kind of 'turning it up'
01:00:47<KitaFox> If 100% isn't loud enough, boosting the sound WILL distort it.
01:00:59<Laevos> Again, that's not the same thing x_x
01:01:12<KitaFox> Yes. And Kita
01:01:43<KitaFox> 's point was that if it is too quiet, trying to make it audible will ruin it all the same.
01:01:45<KitaFox> :<
01:02:06<Laevos> I've never run across anything that was so quiet that listening to it on better speakers couldn't remedy it.
01:02:14<Laevos> Quietness isn't a widespread issue
01:02:21<Laevos> like the so-called 'loudness war'
01:02:25<KitaFox> In rips it is.
01:02:30<Laevos> I'm not talking about rips...
01:02:33<Laevos> I'm talking about source material
01:02:38<Laevos> a shitty rip is a shitty rip
01:02:43<Laevos> that can happen for all sorts of reasons
01:02:55<Laevos> ripping at too low a level included, yes.
01:03:09<Laevos> I make my own rips, though, so that's 100% not my problem >_>
01:03:21<KitaFox> Kita doesn't have the software.
01:03:50<Laevos> For vidya gaym music?
01:04:00<KitaFox> Yeah.
01:04:55<Laevos> That's just nature's way of punishing you for listening to it out of context. :c
01:05:08<Laevos> Hehehe xux
01:05:09<KitaFox> Oi.
01:05:18<KitaFox> Kita has already listened to it IN context.
01:05:30<Laevos> Hehehe
01:05:33<Laevos> just giving you shit :P
01:05:40<Laevos> I can't stand video game/soundtrack music outside of the context
01:05:50<Laevos> I think it's 100% unlistenable outside of the source material
01:05:53<Laevos> as it should be, really, for me
01:05:58<Laevos> it's made with a specific purpose in mind
01:07:33<KitaFox> Video game music is meant to fill an empty soundscape and set the mood. If video game music wasn't a norm set up by previous incarnates of media, like TV shows, movies, and radio programs... Video games would feel natural without music.
01:07:38<KitaFox> Music is powerful.
01:07:46<Laevos> sure
01:08:01<KitaFox> Listening to the music can re-invoke the feelings inspired by its original context.
01:08:12<Laevos> I just don't think that video game music (and other types of 'functional music') are effective outside of the media that they're interwoven with
01:08:20<Laevos> truth be told, I just plain don't think they're as good
01:08:54<KitaFox> Kita disagrees, but half of her music is game music...
01:08:55<KitaFox> So...
01:09:17<KitaFox> Also, as a musician AND a game designer, Kita thinks that judgement is unfair.
01:09:31<KitaFox> Not every video game has a masterpiece of a soundtrack...
01:09:31<Laevos> Value judgments needn't be based on fairness, so nyeh :P
01:09:44<KitaFox> But some of them do.
01:09:46<Laevos> I think a good video game soundtrack is very different from a good album
01:09:50<Laevos> they do different things
01:09:59<KitaFox> They invoke emotions.
01:10:03<Laevos> I don't think that VG music can or should aspire to be 'good music' as I would describe it
01:10:15<KitaFox> You also listen to noise.
01:10:16<KitaFox> :P
01:10:24<Laevos> Yeah, and you say it's not music
01:10:37<Laevos> that's like... YouTube commenter levels of lack-of-thought :c
01:10:47<KitaFox> Not really...?
01:10:50<Laevos> Yes really.
01:11:03<Laevos> That is, in fact, a fairly common YouTube comment.
01:11:15<KitaFox> Noise is just noise. You can make noise in repetitive patterns, or with intense forethought... But noise REALLY isn't music.
01:11:25<Laevos> You're a fucking idiot.
01:11:37<Laevos> It's okay to not like it
01:11:49<Laevos> but to say that is isn't music shows an astonishing lack of critical thinking skills
01:11:54<Laevos> which really shouldn't surprise me at this point.
01:12:04<KitaFox> Lack of critical thinking skills?
01:12:09<Laevos> Indeed.
01:12:17<Laevos> Or perhaps thinking skills, full stop.
01:13:35<KitaFox> Okay... It is obvious Kita has hit a button.
01:14:09<Laevos> I don't like talking with you about music. You have the tastes and depth-of-listening of a fifteen year old boy, and it fills me with an intense hatred.
01:14:53<KitaFox> Comparing Kita to a fifteen year old boy doesn't make her very compelled to listen to you.
01:15:01<Laevos> Just fuck off
01:15:07<Laevos> im' gongt o cry myself to sleep mnow
01:15:10<KitaFox> Nor does getting angry about it, really.
01:19:02<Laevos> i laways push people away... you shouldjust blokck me and forget i ever existed in the frsitp lace
01:19:18<KitaFox> You're going to regret saying these things in the morning.
01:19:19<KitaFox> :<
01:19:23<Laevos> already  do
01:19:30<Laevos> jst kill m epleze
01:19:54<Laevos> get so upset  over the stupidest things
01:20:00<KitaFox> Are you actually mad at Kita? Or are you mad at yourself, at this point?
01:20:08<Laevos> hate myself
01:20:18<KitaFox> Because this could be an example of self-destructive tendencies...
01:20:28<Laevos> always sabotague myself
01:20:33<KitaFox> Which is common in socially competent anti-social personalities.
01:20:56<Laevos> what's wrong with me
01:20:59<Laevos> why am I like this?
01:21:36<KitaFox> This is the point in which, if Kita says anything more, Kita has to make it very, very clear that KITA IS NOT A DOCTOR.
01:21:43<Laevos> ok
01:21:56<KitaFox> So, Lilith should seek a PROFESSIONAL PSYCHIATRIC SPECIALIST in the matter.
01:22:38<Laevos> kita could shoot lilith in the head and she wouldn't be able to lash out at people ianymore
01:22:48<Laevos> then she'd be fixed
01:23:47<KitaFox> No.
01:23:58<KitaFox> You're also not suicidal.
01:24:15<KitaFox> Otherwise you'd be asking for Kita to STOP you from killing yourself.
01:24:16<Laevos> so pathetic... I got pent up but then the person i was talking to went to sleep and never got any less tense and on edge and i feel so sick with myself
01:24:39<KitaFox> Kita has an exercise that she has people go through.
01:25:04<KitaFox> Get up, go to the kitchen or bathroom... And get a glass of water. Drink it, and come back.
01:25:51<Laevos> iwaaaaaaant to stay in bed and fester until i'm nothing...
01:26:04<KitaFox> Do as Kita says.
01:26:29<KitaFox> It will either focus the problem, or alleviate some of that pent up energy.
01:26:37<Laevos> please... just cut me ot of your life like the cancer I am... I'll keep ttrying ot cling on but just cut me away
01:26:50<KitaFox> Lilith.
01:26:53<KitaFox> Do as you are told.
01:27:04<KitaFox> Divine Command.
01:27:33<Laevos> yes goddss
01:27:42<KitaFox> Good girl.
01:29:03<Laevos> okay gotw ater
01:29:26<KitaFox> Did you drink it AWAY from the computer?
01:29:30<Laevos> yes
01:29:41<KitaFox> Good girl.
01:29:43<KitaFox> Feel any better?
01:29:46<Laevos> drank out of the tap since we don't have glasses clean
01:29:57<KitaFox> That's okay.
01:30:14<Laevos> a bit more fatiigiuied but still like i'm a malignant tumor on the lives of everyone iiiiiinknow
01:30:31<KitaFox> So the problem has been focused
01:30:35<KitaFox> Okay.
01:31:06<KitaFox> The socially competent side of you views the anti-social tendencies as a curse.
01:31:34<KitaFox> They hold it back. It wants to be free of the 1-ton weight pulling down on it, so that it may climb to success.
01:32:18<KitaFox> The anti-social side of you views the socially competent side as a parasite. It wants to be cut away from everyone, to starve it of food.
01:33:10<KitaFox> You have social skills.
01:33:18<KitaFox> You hate people.
01:33:27<KitaFox> It really is that simple, in essence.
01:34:01<KitaFox> The socially competent side feels starved, so it clings to physical attention as an obvious codifier of social success, which feeds it.
01:34:33<KitaFox> The anti-social side feels trapped, so it lashes out at people to make THEM choose to go away... to justify its own thoughts and desires.
01:34:58<KitaFox> ...Make sense?
01:35:32<Laevos> yes
01:35:48<KitaFox> Sound like your internal brainmeats?
01:38:43<Laevos> sounds like us, sounds like me
01:39:28<Laevos> it's why maybe
01:39:32<Laevos> maybe why I
01:39:52<Laevos> like to cuddle and be close and intimate and soft
01:40:10<Laevos> but listen to music and enjoy media that displays such a depep-seated misanthropy
01:40:38<KitaFox> You're an introvert.
01:40:47<KitaFox> too many people overloads you.
01:40:49<Laevos> there's another explanation for it that's more circumstantial, just for tonight
01:40:56<KitaFox> ?
01:41:13<Laevos> maybe my brain doesn't get enough happy things
01:41:15<Laevos> endorphins
01:41:16<Laevos> and so
01:41:26<Laevos> it thought it was going to get a lot of them
01:41:28<Laevos> but it didn't
01:41:34<Laevos> and it was mad at me
01:42:00<Laevos> and punished me by making me irratable and un-bound like a guitar string being cut suddenly from taut
01:42:14<Laevos> snapping off and causing welts or worse
01:42:33<KitaFox> You seem to deny yourself pleasantries, do to a lack of self-perceived perfection.
01:43:04<KitaFox> Punishment, for not being better, because you don't realise that you cannot be better without having those pleasantries to lose.
01:43:16<KitaFox> due*
01:43:51<Laevos> was talking to someone else
01:43:55<Laevos> they fell asleep
01:44:00<Laevos> didn't want to continue on my own
01:44:02<Laevos> it was too lonely
01:44:19<KitaFox> You only allow yourself pleasure derived from other people interacting with you.
01:44:35<KitaFox> It is a reward for overcoming the dueling perspectives within you.
01:45:10<KitaFox> You need to stop denying yourself things that would make you happy that you could do.
01:46:07<KitaFox> You idolise Kita because she does something you can't bring yourself to do.
01:46:18<KitaFox> She indulges herself. Constant decadance.
01:47:45<Laevos> lilith's partner in the UK is similar though not to the same extent
01:48:09<KitaFox> She gets drunk. She gets high. She says stupid shit to make herself feel better. She watches TV shows. She plays video games. She listens to music without some intellectual high seat governing how she classifies and expresses her opinions about it. Kita, ultimately, doesn't care about her place in the world.
01:48:35<KitaFox> Kita only cares about the world's place in HER.
01:48:52<KitaFox> Lilith, on some level, wishes she could have some of that feeling.
01:48:57<Laevos> maybe
01:49:01<Laevos> but i never oculd
01:49:08<Laevos> i care a lot what other people think about me
01:49:16<Laevos> what my place in thew roold is
01:49:21<Laevos> if i'm flollowing my own rules
01:49:42<KitaFox> That is part of Kita's appeal, to Lilith.
01:49:58<KitaFox> Kita doesn't bind herself with rules. She does what she wants.
01:50:20<KitaFox> Lilith creates her rules in an expression of her freedom to do so.
01:50:39<KitaFox> Kita lives without them in an expression of her freedom to do so.
01:51:12<Laevos> lilith likes to be dominated, to be taken control of, to have all choice removed from her... to be subservient and submit to... anything, anyone that will take her
01:51:34<KitaFox> But Lilith needs concrete choices presented to her... And Kita gives her that second choice.
01:51:45<KitaFox> "Do what I say, or do what SHE says?"
01:52:26<Laevos> what you say, goddess...
01:52:43<KitaFox> When Lilith is presented with a "Do" style of choice, Lilith cannot comprehend the unspoken option...
01:52:46<KitaFox> Do not
01:53:10<KitaFox> In Lilith's mind, there is only one option in a "Do" style of choice.
01:53:29<Laevos> yes...
01:53:29<KitaFox> So a second, concrete option must be given.
01:53:57<KitaFox> This is part of the anti-social side starving the social side.
01:55:15 KitaFox: beeps Lilith's nose.
01:55:28<KitaFox> Seriously.
01:55:34<KitaFox> Psychiatric assistance.
01:55:40<KitaFox> Kita isn't a professional.
01:55:46<Laevos> I believe you
01:56:03<KitaFox> Do not make life-altering decisions with this input at the forefront.
01:56:10<KitaFox> Seriously.
01:56:17<KitaFox> Consult a head doc first.
01:56:31<Laevos> oh, oh no...
01:56:34<Laevos> no it's not like that
01:56:36<Laevos> lilith won't change
01:56:39<Laevos> she won't do anything
01:56:44<Laevos> but remain the same
01:56:48<Laevos> boiling over again and again
01:56:54<Laevos> a parasitic geyser
01:57:02 KitaFox: glares.
01:57:11<KitaFox> She. A. Shrink.
01:57:21<KitaFox> See*
01:57:24<KitaFox> Also
01:57:29<KitaFox> It is your bedtime.
01:57:36<Laevos> was suppsoed to shower...
01:57:38<Laevos> too late now
01:57:42<Laevos> i feel so disgusting
01:57:56<KitaFox> Shower in the morning.
01:58:01<Laevos> hope I can wake up...
01:58:03<KitaFox> Wake up earlier.
01:58:06<Laevos> my phone broke
01:58:10<Laevos> it was my main alarm
01:58:13<KitaFox> Set an alarm on your computer.
01:58:18<Laevos> doesn't have...
01:58:21<KitaFox> There is a website that does it.
01:58:24<Laevos> oh, that
01:58:26<KitaFox> It works.
01:58:34<Laevos> it's hard too feel like I can...
01:58:36<Laevos> to
01:59:02<KitaFox> Do it.
02:00:45<Laevos> okay
02:01:58<KitaFox> Kita is sorry about being so forceful.
02:02:01<KitaFox> But
02:02:13<KitaFox> If she isn't forceful, Lilith won't change.
02:02:37<KitaFox> And Lilith, for her own sake, not Kita's, needs to work on changing and bettering herself.
02:02:53<KitaFox> Kita can deal with it.
02:02:54<KitaFox> Hell.
02:03:00<KitaFox> She is friends with Zemerl.
02:03:02<KitaFox> :P
02:03:21<KitaFox> Lilith does not seem to be capable of dealing with it, totally.
02:03:37<Laevos> you have to put up with both  ofus... i really should just leave you alone forever...\
02:03:49<KitaFox> Lilith is fixable.
02:03:54<KitaFox> Zem is medicatable.
02:04:03<Laevos> one broken person is more than enough to have to look after...
02:04:18<KitaFox> Kita doesn't look after Zemerl.
02:04:28<KitaFox> Kita is just friends with Zemerl.
02:04:50<Laevos> Lilith's an undue burden on you...
02:05:17<KitaFox> Kita chooses to accept it.
02:05:31<KitaFox> It is one of those choices she makes.
02:07:12<KitaFox> Now shhh kitty
02:07:25<Laevos> o...okay
02:07:45 KitaFox: lovingly strokes her ears.
02:08:31<Laevos> prrrr...
02:08:50 KitaFox: rubs her purrbox. :P
02:14:24<Laevos> sorry for everything
02:14:28<Laevos> sleep's taking over
02:15:00<KitaFox> Sleep, love.
02:15:31<Laevos> love you... ;-;
02:15:50<KitaFox> Love you, too.
02:16:53<Laevos> please forgivemem
02:17:35<KitaFox> Lilith's only err was being imperfect, and everyone makes that error.

15:52:39<KitaFox> He is free.
15:52:48<Laevos> Can't :/ Doesn't really work on this computer, I'm afraid @_@
15:52:59<KitaFox> Steam doesn't?
15:53:07<Laevos> Yeah, not really very well
15:53:14<Laevos> if I try to download things on it, it kind of crashes
15:53:20<Laevos> I think the CPU might need new thermal paste
15:53:20<KitaFox> :<
15:53:31<Laevos> even the most trivial things are making it overheat
15:53:34<KitaFox> How old is the computer?
15:53:37<Laevos> and I've vacuumed it out several times by now
15:53:40<Laevos> uhh, bought it used
15:53:44<Laevos> it's a Dell Latitude E6410
15:53:50<Laevos> I've had it for almost a year
15:53:52<KitaFox> Can you get a manufacturing window?
15:57:55<KitaFox> OH GOD
15:58:01<KitaFox> BIG BAND
15:58:02<KitaFox> IS PUNNY
15:58:07<KitaFox> LIKE MS. FORTUNE.
15:58:15<Laevos> Maybe... 2010ish
15:58:24<Laevos> Hehehehe xux
15:58:27<Laevos> that's wonderful
15:58:28<KitaFox> Ah.
15:58:33<KitaFox> The thermal paste may need a redux.
15:58:45<Laevos> that's what I said omgggggg
15:58:50<Laevos> but yeah
15:58:53<Laevos> it's a bit dated
15:58:53<KitaFox> "Now that's just bassist." - Big Band
15:59:02<Laevos> DisplayPort, no HDMI
15:59:25<KitaFox> No HDMI?
15:59:28<Laevos> Nope
15:59:29<KitaFox> For a 2010 computer?
15:59:32<Laevos> yep
15:59:32<KitaFox> o.x
15:59:52<Laevos> "The Latitude E6410 is packed with a ton of connections, including three USB 2.0 ports, an eSATA/USB combo port, VGA and DisplayPort-out, audio jacks, LAN, and FireWire-400. Other features include an optical drive, SDHC-card reader, and a SmartCard reader."
16:00:09<KitaFox> FIREWIRE
16:00:15<KitaFox> And SMARTCARD?
16:00:18 KitaFox: snickers.
16:00:18<Laevos> Yes
16:00:19<KitaFox> Wow.
16:00:25<KitaFox> That IS dated.
16:00:28<Laevos> Mhm
16:00:51<Laevos> the Firewire would actually be useful to me if I had the right hardware.
16:00:56<Laevos> But I don't, currently.
16:00:58<KitaFox> Big Band has TRUMPETKNEES.
16:01:00<Laevos> :3
16:01:16<KitaFox> EVERYTHING ABOUT BIG BAND IS AMAZING
16:03:21<KitaFox> "HellooooOOOO Nurse!" - Peacock
16:03:36<Laevos> Indeed, that's one of her lines >u>
16:03:55<KitaFox> Peacock is inappropriate.
16:03:56<KitaFox> :<
16:03:59<Laevos> o;
16:04:02<KitaFox> Also a cyborg.
16:04:04<Laevos> Yes
16:04:18<KitaFox> AND REALLY FUCKING ANNOYING
16:04:27<Laevos> She's gr8
16:04:47<Laevos> I can't play well as her (or anyone else) but it's always nice to see people who can
16:04:53<Laevos> works well with Cerebella
16:05:02<KitaFox> Works better with BIG BAND
16:05:09<Laevos> Maybe so.
16:05:15<KitaFox> INB4: Big Band replaces the Big Zam meme.
16:05:23<Laevos> Dunno what that is
16:05:49<Laevos> also not sure if I'll ever be able to play Skullgirls again @_@
16:05:52<Laevos> Just for sentimental reasons
16:05:56<Laevos> regardless of computron
16:06:53<KitaFox> Big Zam is a character from Gundam, and the Game Grumps, Arin Hanson and Danny Sexbang, got a hold of some PSX Gundam fighter... Where Danny would ONLY pick Big Zam, the biggest Gundam in the game, and the game's Arcade Mode's final boss.
16:07:28<Laevos> Oh, okay
16:07:46<KitaFox> But Big Zam is so comically large...
16:07:57<KitaFox> And he can't turn around very well.
16:08:12<KitaFox> You actually have to perform a combo to turn around with Big Zam.
16:08:12<Laevos> That's PS1 final bosses for you
16:08:21<Laevos> too big (for Brawl 2)

19:51:25<Laevos> It's okay
19:51:29<Laevos> you can fiddle all you want bb ;3
19:51:53 KitaFox: gets a puzzled look on her face, then chucks the trumpet away. She begins fiddling with a theramin, instead. Much more interesting.
19:52:05<Laevos> It makes sounds when you're close to it
19:52:11<Laevos> and different sounds when you're differently close to it
19:52:23<KitaFox> Much like a Russian hooker.
19:52:48<Laevos> Kita will have to let me know all about Russian sex workers, as Lilith knows nothing about them ;w;
19:53:29 KitaFox: only knows that they do the noise thing, have sex in exchange for monetary benefits, and aren't very good at it!

20:14:45 Laevos: smooches softly and offers you another spoonful~ <3
20:15:07 KitaFox: happily slides the ice cream off the spoon.
20:15:47<Laevos> Mmh... good Goddess! ^//////^ Enjoying that~? <3
20:16:22 KitaFox: nods, her cheeks flushed.
20:16:23<KitaFox> :<
20:18:16<Laevos> Blushy or overheated Goddess? ;n;
20:18:28<KitaFox> Feverish.
20:18:32<Laevos> Oh no Dx
20:18:42 Laevos: brings in some fans to cool you down and gives you more ice cream ;-;
20:18:54 KitaFox: licks at the ice cream.
20:19:55 Laevos: puts a wet washcloth on your forehead, nuzzling gently... "Lilith loves you Q_Q"
20:20:23 KitaFox: chirps, softly.
20:20:41<Laevos> Beautiful Goddess... I hope you get well soon ;~;
20:20:56 KitaFox: twitches her tails.
20:21:15 Laevos: offers you some medicine for your fever ;~;
20:21:29 KitaFox: nods.
20:22:12 Laevos: pours a spoonfull and brings close to your lips, "It might not taste the best, but Kita can have all the ice cream she wants if she takes her medicine <3"
20:22:41 KitaFox: happily takes the spoon.
20:22:41<KitaFox> n.n
20:22:55<Laevos> Good Kita! :3
20:23:13 Laevos: begins feeding you the rest of the ice cream, scoop after frosty, minty scoop~
20:23:23<KitaFox> Kita likes cherry flavoured medicines.
20:23:27<Laevos> Good!:3

00:07:32<KitaFox> Criminal Minds...
00:08:09<KitaFox> The episode was about them catching two hunters who would kidnap people, strip them of valuables, and then hunt them in the Idaho wilderness.
00:08:26<KitaFox> They save the last victim...
00:09:29<KitaFox> "She asked me, how could they do something like this. I said it was because they don't think like us, but really, we do think like them... ...We hunt these people every day. The real question is how different are we?"
00:09:59<KitaFox> (For context, the character saying that was a member of the FBI BAU.)
00:10:17<KitaFox> This show is quote gold
00:12:07<Laevos> Oh hi :3
00:12:18<KitaFox> :<
00:12:28<Laevos> Sorry, was brushing my teeth ;n;
00:12:56 KitaFox: noses.
00:13:00 Laevos: licks <3
00:13:10<KitaFox> But yeah
00:13:18<KitaFox> That quote was excellently delivered.
00:13:51<Laevos> Yes :3
00:15:40 KitaFox: nuzzles.
00:15:48 Laevos: snuggles
00:16:13 KitaFox: blows bubbles at.
00:16:35<Laevos> o_o
00:18:56<KitaFox> Kita is currently working on an articulated doll.
00:19:07<KitaFox> Made of sapphire
00:19:52<Laevos> Ooh :3
00:20:10 KitaFox: nibbles at her own knuckles.
00:21:02 Laevos: nibbles at Kita's knuckles with her ;u;
00:21:34<KitaFox> Sapphire is beautiful...
00:21:40<KitaFox> But her tools scratch it.
00:22:52<Laevos> Awwwh...
00:23:05<KitaFox> So she has to be careful.
00:23:20<KitaFox> The custom cuts were expensive.
00:25:15<Laevos> Eep @_@
00:25:37<KitaFox> But... The time and money will be worth it...
00:25:59<Laevos> It sounds like it'll be wonderful <3
00:26:24<KitaFox> It is actually sapphire reinforcement to a small, robotic skeletal frame.
00:27:17<Laevos> Oh wow o:
00:27:21<Laevos> I wanna see ;n;
00:28:18<KitaFox> The robotic skeleton is photosensitive to rust... Requires darkroom tactics...
00:28:38<KitaFox> Requires some treating... A lacquer paint.
00:28:38<Laevos> Q_Q
00:28:41<Laevos> Fair enough
00:33:51<KitaFox> Just...
00:33:57<KitaFox> Gotta make it fit together.
00:34:05<Laevos> You can do it!
00:34:07<KitaFox> Then...
00:34:11<KitaFox> Take it apart...
00:34:44<KitaFox> Paint all the pieces...
00:34:50<KitaFox> Then refit.
00:35:12<Laevos> @_@
00:35:23<KitaFox> And it will wait for a storage device small enough to fit inside, and human personality to be put in said storage device.
00:37:55<Laevos> :3
00:39:07 KitaFox: fidgets with it...
00:39:17 Laevos: peers at ;u;
00:39:21<KitaFox> The computer is behind a UV screen.
00:40:49 Laevos: nodnods

00:53:58<KitaFox> Kita went to college...
00:54:16<KitaFox> Know what she got her degree in?
00:57:42<Laevos> What? o:
00:59:39<KitaFox> Robotics engineering
00:59:45<Laevos> :3
01:00:18<KitaFox> Before Kita lost her marbles...
01:00:24<KitaFox> she was a genius
01:00:38<KitaFox> General IQof 149.
01:01:20<KitaFox> Dimmed by the drugs and constant high.
01:01:36<KitaFox> And the psychological trauma.

01:45:14 KitaFox: shakes her head.
01:50:15 KitaFox: fiddles with a small walking machine...
01:50:53<KitaFox> Kita's home is filled with robotics... She used to build them... Hundreds of small, pieced together robots...
01:51:21<KitaFox> And then, on the days where she could no longer contain her murderous impulses... She would destroy them.
01:51:29<KitaFox> Smash them, rip them apart...
01:52:32<KitaFox> Turn them on, and then swing a bat, to watch them fly and smash against the wall.
01:52:46<KitaFox> Kita doesn't do that anymore...
01:52:59<KitaFox> But she also doesn't build as many...

01:25:41<KitaFox> Good girl
01:25:51<Laevos> I'm so scared
01:25:57<Laevos> I've never taken anything like this ever
01:25:57<KitaFox> They'll adjust them, accordingly.
01:26:00<Laevos> my brain doesn't like it
01:26:15<KitaFox> It just isn't used to it.
01:26:17<Laevos> I kept it clean for so long...
01:26:21<Laevos> i've dirtied it...
01:26:25<KitaFox> Hey.
01:26:30<KitaFox> No.
01:26:38<KitaFox> You have not.
01:26:50<KitaFox> You're fixing it.
01:27:08<KitaFox> You're putting glue in the cracks.. Just gotta little too much, right now.
01:27:14<KitaFox> Pretty common with dosings.
01:27:25<Laevos> I'm supposed to double my dosage after three more days
01:27:32<KitaFox> Well...
01:27:41<KitaFox> It could be you have too little.
01:27:55<KitaFox> That is also possible.
01:28:09<Laevos> the back of my head feels numb
01:28:27 KitaFox: holds her hand out for Lilith.
01:28:32<KitaFox> It's okay.
01:28:57 Laevos: licks
01:29:52<KitaFox> Babe..
01:30:01<KitaFox> "Purity" is a false concept.
01:30:15<KitaFox> It was created as part of a control scheme.
01:30:35<KitaFox> There is no such thing as purity, outside of chemical separation.
01:31:49<KitaFox> Your mind is supposed to be the one place where you feel safe and good about yourself.
01:32:05<KitaFox> If you don't, then you need an adjustment.

02:10:41<KitaFox> You just want to quit, and that is an easy way to do so.
02:10:49<KitaFox> Dying is permanent.
02:11:00<KitaFox> Misery is almost always temporary.
02:11:12<KitaFox> You make it permanent by self-harming.

15:27:08<KitaFox> Different amounts have different effects.

15:38:36<KitaFox> It was producing the same chemicals.
15:38:37<Laevos> of things like  this
15:38:43<KitaFox> That medication?
15:39:04<KitaFox> It is just a concentrated version of something already in your brain.

15:44:25<KitaFox> It did not give you a disease.
15:44:43<KitaFox> It provoked a disease you already had, by not being the right amount.
15:44:48<Laevos> i wish i could mkae it go away by making myself throw up and purging it form my ssytem but i can't throw up my brain
15:45:03<KitaFox> Once again: Stop making decisions during paranoid delusions.
15:45:28<Laevos> it's the fucking medicine givin gme deliusions
15:45:44<KitaFox> No, it really isn't.
15:45:54<Laevos> three panic attacksi in oneeday
15:45:56<Laevos> that's never hapepend
15:45:58<KitaFox> It is a side-effect because it can exacerbate them.
15:45:59<Laevos> never ever
15:46:11<KitaFox> But you've had panick attacks before.
15:46:23<KitaFox> Just not as many at one time.

17:50:31<KitaFox> :<
17:50:43<Laevos> it's on its way to the city dump now
17:50:45<Laevos> all of it
17:50:59<KitaFox> Too bad.
17:52:50<Laevos> I feel so much better...
17:54:00<KitaFox> Because you fulfilled a paranoia-driven delusion.
17:54:44<Laevos> and in the end, what else is happiness
17:55:19<KitaFox> Your paranoia was baseless.
17:55:25<KitaFox> :<
17:56:06<KitaFox> Some temporary discomfort sparked a pre-existing condition that typically goes unnoticed because you are rarely in new forms of discomfort.

22:29:49<Laevos> Hi there :3
22:30:00 KitaFox: whimpers.
22:31:10<Laevos> Mewmew? :c
22:31:32<KitaFox> Ugh.
22:31:42<Laevos> What's wrong? Dx
22:31:45<KitaFox> Was doing some online D&D with some people.
22:31:48<KitaFox> Playing a Ranger.
22:32:01<Laevos> Yeah? ;n;
22:32:23<KitaFox> (Kita likes Rangers... They get both magic, and martial combat... She likes to be versatile, so she could supplement a weaker party member.)
22:33:06<Laevos> What went wrong?
22:33:12<KitaFox> Everything?
22:33:18<Laevos> Oh :c
22:33:25<KitaFox> First off, two out of the five players were munchkins.
22:33:53<KitaFox> So, Kita's ranger just became another body to distract enemies in combat, to prevent the munchkins from getting swarmed.
22:34:10<Laevos> Bluh
22:34:10<KitaFox> Second, Kita was the only Good character. Everyone else was neutral.
22:34:24<Laevos> lol x_x
22:34:41<KitaFox> Five players, 1 good character, 1 lawful character, the rest were Chaotic Neutral.
22:34:52<KitaFox> Kita was Neutral Good.
22:35:07<Laevos> o.e
22:35:52<KitaFox> Both munchkins were Chaotic Neutral, one was a Bard, the other a Wizard.
22:35:59<KitaFox> Two magical munchkins.
22:36:33<KitaFox> First thing. The characters are assembled.. This goes awfully for the Ranger.
22:36:48<KitaFox> Immediately the other players are planning on STEALING shit.
22:37:01<Laevos> x~x
22:37:18<Laevos> So you attacked them, right?
22:37:20<KitaFox> The Ranger doesn't see a reason to steal things. The people in the house were good people, rich, but good. They didn't seem to be hurting anyone.
22:37:22<KitaFox> No.
22:37:26<Laevos> :c
22:37:36<KitaFox> Just watched, while expressing my displeasure with their actions.
22:38:49<KitaFox> The other characters then spent the rest of the game ribbing the Ranger for being a wimp.
22:39:02<Laevos> That's silly
22:39:24<KitaFox> But really, it was the final straw.
22:39:33<Laevos> yeah xnx
22:39:49<KitaFox> We were up against a minor arc villain, in the door way to his room. He was asleep.
22:40:09<KitaFox> Bard casts a spell so that only we can hear eachother.
22:41:30<KitaFox> Ranger says the Rogue should check for traps. No one argues, but the rogue states, probably rightfully so, that the guy wouldn't risk accidentally activating a deadly trap, or a permanently annoying trap in the room.
22:42:23<KitaFox> Rogue than states, in Elven, that the Barbarian, who doesn't speak Elven, needs a reason to get pissed off and violently murder the guy anyway.
22:42:28<KitaFox> Also a sound statement.
22:42:36<KitaFox> So we tell the Barbarian to go first.
22:42:43<KitaFox> Barbarian responds...
22:43:04<KitaFox> "In my clan, we don't let no knife ears tell us what to do."
22:43:27<Laevos> l@l o_o
22:43:59<KitaFox> Then pushes the Ranger forward, while saying "Let the pussy go first. Maybe she'll grow a pair, like real woman."
22:44:21<Laevos> x_x
22:44:23<KitaFox> Trap activates.
22:44:37<KitaFox> Eviscerated, because I failed the save.
22:44:45<KitaFox> The will save.
22:44:49<KitaFox> WILL SAVE
22:44:56<KitaFox> THEY MADE A RANGER TAKE A WILL SAVE.
22:44:58<Laevos> who are these jackasses that you're playing with and /why/ are you playing them...?
22:44:59 KitaFox: screams.
22:45:13<KitaFox> Just some people from an LFG thing...
22:45:19<Laevos> LFG?
22:45:26<KitaFox> Looking for group.
22:45:59<Laevos> Oh. So some kind of online matchmaking thing?
22:46:18<KitaFox> Yeah.
22:46:27<Laevos> Sounds like the worst idea xnx
22:46:28<KitaFox> And the Rogue wasn't a jackass...
22:46:33<KitaFox> Just playing the character.
22:46:48<KitaFox> He, like in that moment, was trying to help.
22:46:48<Laevos> I wouldn't even attempt to play D&D with some random group
22:47:02<KitaFox> As to why Kita was playing with them?
22:47:08<KitaFox> NO ONE ELSE WILL FUCKING PLAY
22:47:13<Laevos> :c
22:47:14<KitaFox> ;.;
22:47:20<Laevos> I would...
22:47:22<KitaFox> They either HATE 3.5...
22:47:27<KitaFox> Or hate D&D.
22:47:42<KitaFox> And Kita would be fine with that...
22:47:44<KitaFox> Except...
22:48:00<KitaFox> D&D players who don't play 3.5 play the inferior AD&D or Pathfinder.
22:48:10<Laevos> Those are both worse, yeah
22:48:14<KitaFox> The people who hate D&D play World of Darkness, or Pathfinder.
22:48:17<Laevos> & for babies
22:48:35<KitaFox> AD&D is not for babies... But it isn't better than 3.5.
22:48:43<KitaFox> World of Darkness is for babies.
22:48:45<KitaFox> Emo babies.
22:48:50<Laevos> It is babies
22:48:56<Laevos> ENTIRE TEAM IS BABIES
22:49:08<KitaFox> :P
22:49:15<Laevos> hehehe
22:49:21<Laevos> Super-low tonight
22:49:29<Laevos> got a ride back to my mom's with my sister
22:49:44<KitaFox> o.o
22:49:48<KitaFox> Super-low?
22:50:01<Laevos> spent a few hours after dinner installing some DOTA clone to play with my brother
22:50:09<Laevos> it finally finished
22:50:13<Laevos> and we had to go back
22:50:25<Laevos> I couldn't stay because I left my car in Lawrence
22:50:33<Laevos> so just feeling crappy now
22:50:36<KitaFox> :<
22:50:45<KitaFox> Well
22:50:47<KitaFox> Kita is here
22:50:52<KitaFox> And feeling crappy, too.
22:50:56<Laevos> yay xnx
22:51:07<KitaFox> Half-Orcs suck.
22:51:12<Laevos> also getting yelled at by someone
22:51:19<KitaFox> Who?
22:51:36<Laevos> a partner who doesn't think I should physically be around anyone else
22:51:47<KitaFox> Is it your main partner?
22:51:50<Laevos> and I'm going to the UK over the summer to visit another partner
22:51:51<Laevos> no
22:51:55<KitaFox> Oh.
22:52:04<KitaFox> Dump 'em.
22:52:06 KitaFox: shrugs.
22:52:15<Laevos> can't
22:52:22<KitaFox> Why not?
22:52:33<Laevos> I'm a terrible person and the one at fault
22:52:38<KitaFox> No you're not.
22:52:49<Laevos> the other partner in the UK doesn't know that I still talk to this person
22:52:59<Laevos> and would probably kill themself if they did
22:53:15<KitaFox> I meant dump this person who is being an asshat.
22:53:24<KitaFox> :|
22:53:28<Laevos> I know, but...
22:53:51<Laevos> being alone would be worse
22:53:53<KitaFox> If they aren't your main, they're not allowed to call for exclusivity.
22:53:54<Laevos> even though
22:54:04<KitaFox> And you should tell them that.
22:54:14<KitaFox> Your relationships are YOUR decisions.
22:54:17<Laevos> I can't see the person who wants exclusivity for another two years
22:54:18<Laevos> I mean
22:54:21<Laevos> they both want that
22:54:31<Laevos> just only one of them knows that the other exists
22:54:34<KitaFox> Humans don't work that way, though.
22:54:55<KitaFox> There is a cultural delusion that humans are wired for monogamy.
22:55:00<KitaFox> But... they aren't.
22:55:05<KitaFox> They really aren't.
22:55:10<Laevos> and said person is under the impression that they're more important
22:55:18<Laevos> that I need them more
22:55:23<KitaFox> Then they are probably unobservant.
22:55:24<Laevos> I don't know
22:55:42<Laevos> I should probably leave both of them and just resign myself to being alone
22:55:42<KitaFox> You can find another fling.
22:56:02<KitaFox> In fact, you can find another fling, AFTER discussing your needs with your partner in the UK.
22:56:10<KitaFox> Which is ultimately the smart deal.
22:56:35<Laevos> Every time I try to talk to them about my needs as far as relationships go they try and kill themselves
22:56:41<KitaFox> ...
22:56:55<KitaFox> then they need psychological help, and are not mature enough to be dating.
22:56:55<Laevos> because they can NOT get over the idea that it's because they're somehow not good enough
22:57:00<KitaFox> As harsh as that sounds.
22:57:05<Laevos> I know.
22:57:12<KitaFox> It might help to tell them that NO ONE is good enough.
22:57:16<KitaFox> Not even you.
22:57:17<Laevos> They stalked me into being with them again a few years ago
22:57:35<Laevos> they're obsessed. I tried to cut off all ties but gave in
22:57:36<KitaFox> You're not responsible for this person, m'love.
22:57:51<Laevos> If I didn't have them... I'd have nobody
22:57:59<KitaFox> You have Kita.
22:58:00<KitaFox> :<
22:58:05<Laevos> and being with people who are terrible for/to me is better tnan having nobody
22:58:12<Laevos> Lilith requires physical contact
22:58:22<KitaFox> And this person in the UK does not provide that.
22:58:33<Laevos> when I visit them they do
22:58:41<KitaFox> You don't have to visit them.
22:58:55<KitaFox> In fact, it is overall cheaper, and safer to not.
22:58:57<Laevos> sure it's once or twice a year but that's more than nothing
22:59:08<Laevos> why would I choose to be alone...?
22:59:21<KitaFox> Because you can always go meet people.
22:59:52<Laevos> No I can't... I don't meet people...
23:00:02<KitaFox> Yeah, you can.
23:00:05<KitaFox> You met Kita.
23:00:24<Laevos> and Kita's already said that we can't meet in the foreseeable future...
23:00:35<KitaFox> Immediate. Kita said immediate.
23:00:48<Laevos> so probably years...?
23:01:00<Laevos> not asking you to rush, it's just the reality
23:01:02<KitaFox> Where do you live, Lilith?
23:01:12<Laevos> Kansas
23:01:22<KitaFox> Or, what is the population of your living area.
23:01:39<Laevos> Colege students
23:01:49<KitaFox> Number
23:01:59<Laevos> the vilest creatures on this earth
23:02:03<KitaFox> ...
23:02:04<Laevos> dunno...
23:02:11<KitaFox> College students are not vile.
23:02:11<Laevos> several thousand...?
23:02:19<Laevos> they go out to bars
23:02:19<KitaFox> Kita is a college graduate.
23:02:22<KitaFox> So?
23:02:32<KitaFox> Bars can be nice. Kita goes and plays at one.
23:02:34<Laevos> I can't be around people that do that for very long
23:02:48<KitaFox> Just don't go to bars with them.
23:03:06<Laevos> it's ALL they fucking do in tnis city
23:03:12<KitaFox> Because they are bored.
23:03:27<KitaFox> That is probably all there is to do in that city.
23:03:35<Laevos> bars are the only form of socializing seen as legigimate
23:03:50<KitaFox> Not... really?
23:04:01<Laevos> here they are.
23:04:01<KitaFox> You play D&D
23:04:05<Laevos> played
23:04:08<Laevos> past tense
23:04:15<KitaFox> You would never play again?
23:04:19<Laevos> with people I could open up with from fucking highschool
23:04:27<Laevos> who have all now disowned me
23:04:41<KitaFox> Okay. How about... In spite of those people.
23:04:52<KitaFox> To prove that they weren't good people...
23:04:59<KitaFox> You use the activity to make new friends.
23:06:34<KitaFox> You're not incapable of meeting people or making friends.
23:07:01<KitaFox> You've got a lot of negativity, which is expected from someone who was violently outcast from their most comfortable peergroup...
23:07:10<KitaFox> But you can't let your past control your future.
23:07:17<KitaFox> You can't. It will kill you.
23:07:20<KitaFox> It will.
23:07:42<KitaFox> That isn't a guess... It is a guarantee.
23:08:06<Laevos> I've never... made a friend in person since then
23:08:21<KitaFox> Because you are afraid of it happening again.
23:08:33<KitaFox> And fear is okay. Everyone has fears.
23:09:12<Laevos> I never made friends since the first two who weren't friends of them
23:09:15<Laevos> in person...
23:09:28<KitaFox> That's okay.
23:09:39<KitaFox> You just don't have practice.
23:12:11<Laevos> I don't feel like I can do anything...
23:12:32 KitaFox: noses under her chin.
23:12:38<KitaFox> Then fake that you do.
23:13:03<Laevos> I don't know how...
23:13:39<KitaFox> Go look in a mirror and just repeat that you are confident in different ways, until one seems convincing enough to pass in a social setting.
23:14:18<KitaFox> Basically, until you can ignore the terror.
23:14:20<Laevos> that works for you, huh??
23:14:26<Laevos> Err, just one ?
23:14:35 KitaFox: shrugs.
23:14:45<KitaFox> Took years before Kita actually felt confident.
23:14:53<KitaFox> She treated it like roleplaying a character.
23:14:59<KitaFox> Wearing a mask of bravado.
23:15:18<KitaFox> Not actually feeling like the hottest fox in the room, but lying and saying she was.
23:15:52<Laevos> I hate bravado... I wouldn't want to display it
23:16:04<Laevos> and people who display it put me off...
23:16:12<KitaFox> Kita didn't.
23:16:13<KitaFox> :3
23:16:21<KitaFox> And Kita is super full of herself.
23:16:21<KitaFox> <3
23:16:37<Laevos> deities are an exception
23:16:40<Laevos> heart
23:16:41<KitaFox> :P
23:17:26<KitaFox> Seriously though...
23:17:39<KitaFox> If you're not confident... Pretend you are someone who is.
23:17:54<Laevos> I don't want0 to be confident...
23:18:00<Laevos> I don't want to have to lie
23:18:09<KitaFox> You wouldn't be lying, really.
23:18:15<Laevos> that's probably why I won't meet anyone in person
23:18:20<KitaFox> Its like wearing a costume.
23:18:47<KitaFox> You are still you, but you've got the costume there to protect people from criticising YOU.
23:19:01<KitaFox> If they don't like you, it just means they don't like the costume.
23:19:06<Laevos> I don't want to have to create someone 'worth' being liked because I'm not good enough...
23:19:19<KitaFox> Kita thinks Lilith is good enough.
23:19:20<Laevos> my self-esteem is low enough as it is
23:20:03 KitaFox: hugs tight.
23:20:18<KitaFox> Lilith, it doesn't get better if you don't do anything.
23:21:19<KitaFox> And you really don't deserve misery and anxiety.
23:22:45<Laevos> I feel like those are... more or less my defining traits
23:22:56<Laevos> sorry if I'm slow, my sister's driving through the country
23:23:05<Laevos> bad 3G signal
23:23:40<KitaFox> Babe...
23:23:54<KitaFox> You seriously don't deserve it.
23:24:22<Laevos> the universe doesn't care what a person might or might not deserve...
23:24:49<KitaFox> Sure, but if there are things you can do to pull yourself out of it, you should.
23:24:55<KitaFox> And if there is a thing Kita can do/
23:24:58<KitaFox> ?*
23:25:03<Laevos> Lilith has one skill she can use to get people around her to stay with her
23:25:06<KitaFox> Kita is damn well going to do it.
23:25:14<Laevos> she can make people feel good sexually
23:25:21<Laevos> that is her value
23:25:33 KitaFox: blinks.
23:25:40<KitaFox> So...
23:25:49<KitaFox> Alcohol, drugs, and medicine are bad...
23:25:54<KitaFox> But sex is totally cool.
23:25:58<Laevos> yes
23:26:06 KitaFox: arches her eyebrow.
23:26:09<KitaFox> Interesting.
23:26:22<Laevos> it lets people pretend to care about me
23:26:35<KitaFox> Technically, so do the other three.
23:27:13<KitaFox> You're smart.
23:27:20<KitaFox> You've got your brain...
23:27:28<KitaFox> And during your high points, you're silly and fun.
23:27:34<Laevos> people don't give a shit about that
23:27:40<KitaFox> Kita does.
23:27:41<KitaFox> :<
23:27:48<Laevos> the problem isn't online
23:27:55<Laevos> I can talk to people online
23:27:58<Laevos> and that's fine
23:28:09<KitaFox> There is not "make everyone like you" button.
23:28:10<Laevos> it's in person that I'm boring, invisible
23:28:20<Laevos> I don't want everyone to like me
23:28:25<KitaFox> Everyone is hated, ignored, or disliked by someone.
23:28:32<Laevos> I just don't want to be so alone...
23:28:48<KitaFox> Kita is hated by Kayon, ignored by Devin, and loved by you.
23:28:51<Laevos> having to wait months, or years at a time
23:28:55<KitaFox> All three in the same place.
23:28:59<Laevos> just to be with someone
23:29:08<KitaFox> You can go out and find SOMEONE to hang out with.
23:30:00<Laevos> mew
23:30:02<KitaFox> Hell. Make a metal club at the school. Sure, the initial group will have some notmetalfans people, but there will at least be someone you can discuss music with.
23:30:38<KitaFox> Kita gets that Lilith isn't social.
23:30:53<KitaFox> Hello? Kita spends 98% of her time in her house, hiding from the world.
23:31:01<Laevos> that'd just get me into fights...
23:31:08<Laevos> the metal club thing
23:31:19<KitaFox> Adults, even college-faring adults, are not stupid.
23:31:22<Laevos> kita's also professed not needing physical closeness
23:31:40<KitaFox> Kita also sees people, often enough.
23:32:05<Laevos> I'm just feeling lower and lower tonight...
23:32:13<Laevos> I want to cry...
23:32:19<KitaFox> Then CRY.
23:32:24<KitaFox> Crying is super healthy.
23:32:24<KitaFox> :<
23:32:40<KitaFox> Emotional expressions are legit amounts of healthy.
23:33:07<Laevos> I can't right now
23:33:13<Laevos> in the car with my sister
23:33:22<KitaFox> Can too.
23:33:56<KitaFox> Sure, she might be concerned, but if you don't want to discuss it with her, you don't have to.
23:33:57<Laevos> I'd have to explain it to her
23:34:02<Laevos> not be in the mood to
23:34:04<KitaFox> No, you don't.
23:34:16<KitaFox> You don't ever have to explain yourself to anyone.
23:34:18<KitaFox> Not even Kita.
23:34:19<Laevos> that's just how our relationship is
23:34:37<Laevos> we trust each other and tell each other things, just
23:34:53<Laevos> I'm not in the mood to...
23:34:58<KitaFox> It wouldn't be a matter of trust.
23:35:09<KitaFox> Tell her you'll talk about it later, but it needs out now.
23:36:10<Laevos> the feeling of being about to cry passed
23:36:39<KitaFox> Unfortunate.
23:36:46<KitaFox> It sounded like it needed out.
23:37:48<Laevos> it did... mew xnx
23:37:58<KitaFox> Lilith...
23:38:16<KitaFox> Having feelings is okay...
23:38:29<KitaFox> And expressing them is okay, too.
23:38:43<KitaFox> Got it?
23:39:51<Laevos> yes
23:39:55<KitaFox> Good.
23:40:21<KitaFox> Internalise that.
23:40:27<KitaFox> Let it become part of you.
23:40:33<Laevos> It just would've been rude to start crying right then
23:40:37<KitaFox> BECOME AN EXPRESSIVE BUTTERFLY OF EMOTION.
23:40:38<KitaFox> :<
23:40:40<Laevos> we were having a conversation
23:40:43<KitaFox> Oh.
23:40:49<Laevos> I do express my emotions...
23:41:01<KitaFox> Express the good ones, too, sweets.
23:41:02<KitaFox> <3
23:41:05<Laevos> I'm not some stoic faux-macho piece of shit
23:41:14<KitaFox> No...
23:41:19<KitaFox> But you seem perma-sad.
23:41:48<Laevos> Maybe being online just depresses me
23:42:01<KitaFox> Oi.
23:42:11<Laevos> probably not
23:42:17 KitaFox: is not depressing.
23:42:18<KitaFox> :<
23:42:18<Laevos> but you never know
23:42:23<Laevos> you're not
23:42:32 KitaFox: picks up Lilith.
23:43:04<Laevos> I wish I could come over
23:43:15<KitaFox> Want a happy statement?
23:43:17<Laevos> you don't seem like you just want to use me
23:43:29 KitaFox: rubrubs on her ears.
23:44:20<Laevos> sure
23:44:33<KitaFox> Cuntry would be infinitely more tolerable if it wasn't such a Christian circlejerk.
23:44:34<KitaFox> So
23:44:45<KitaFox> Kita is going to make a country song about Islam.
23:44:55<KitaFox> Or atheism.
23:44:58<KitaFox> For giggles.
23:45:03<Laevos> Country just sounds so groooosss
23:45:24<KitaFox> It would be less gross without the awful accents and the goddildo.
23:45:48<Laevos> yeah riiiight ;n;
23:45:55<KitaFox> No, seriously.
23:46:10<KitaFox> Southern accents are the real gross part.
23:46:27<KitaFox> Banjos are awesome, without the awful southern accents.
23:46:44<KitaFox> (Sidenote: Metal songs need more banjos.)
23:47:39<Laevos> nooo xnx
23:47:45<KitaFox> Yuuuuush
23:47:54<Laevos> enough 'experimental' black metal with 'quirky' instruments
23:47:57<KitaFox> Power metal with banjo solos.
23:48:02<KitaFox> Fuck black metal.
23:48:05 Laevos: applier her corpsepaint
23:48:09<KitaFox> X3
23:48:20<Laevos> it's all Lilith listens to prett much
23:48:31<KitaFox> Power metal is pretty.
23:48:36<KitaFox> Kita likes pretty.
23:48:39<KitaFox> Pretty is good.
23:48:42 KitaFox: murrs.
23:48:55<Laevos> Lilith likes ugliness, wretchedness and vitriol
23:49:07<KitaFox> Lilith should experience more pretty!
23:49:08<KitaFox> :3
23:49:31<Laevos> but it sounds so
23:49:32<Laevos> bad
23:49:35<KitaFox> Bad?
23:49:38<KitaFox> Pretty isn't bad.
23:49:40<KitaFox> :<
23:49:50<KitaFox> There is control, and patterns, and structure.
23:50:00<Laevos> ewwwweww
23:50:02<KitaFox> It is beautious in its ability to come together.
23:50:17<KitaFox> Yuuuuuush.
23:50:23<Laevos> Lilith's lying
23:50:26<KitaFox> XP
23:50:31<Laevos> she likes things she finds pretty
23:50:32<Laevos> but
23:50:39<Laevos> we might not agree
23:50:43<Laevos> on what that is
23:50:54<KitaFox> Screaming about killing jews isn't pretty.
23:50:55<KitaFox> :<
23:51:31<KitaFox> Singing about the glory of a journey across the landscapes of the world to find the place they feel at home, is pretty.
23:51:55<KitaFox> (Screaming about killing anyone isn't pretty. Jews were just the first that came to mind.)
23:52:13<KitaFox> (Nazis and Muslims like Black Metal.
23:52:14<KitaFox> )
23:53:05 KitaFox: melts on
23:53:36<KitaFox> (See? Kita is not a social genius... >.<)
23:53:41<Laevos> Most of the 'muslim black metal ba
23:53:55<Laevos> ' bands are made by white guys in Florida
23:54:00<Laevos> tbh
23:54:00<KitaFox> Sure
23:54:11<KitaFox> They still hate Jews, though.
23:54:28<Laevos> Christians are the primary target
23:54:35<KitaFox> Well
23:54:43<KitaFox> Kita hates all three of them.
23:54:43<KitaFox> So
23:54:46<Laevos> but yeah, some silly folks think it's okay to make it about Jews or Muslims
23:54:47 KitaFox: shrugs?
23:54:57<Laevos> it's not, as that's racist
23:55:14<KitaFox> Or religiously intolerant.
23:55:14<Laevos> but it's not racist to make songs about massacreing Christians
23:55:17<Laevos> so that's fine
23:56:09<KitaFox> (Not Black Metal) Cattle Decapitations "Forced Gender Reassignment" is a good example of it being "okay" to hate Christians.
23:56:18<Laevos> Christians aren't a persecuted minority
23:56:22<KitaFox> Decapatation's*
23:56:26<Laevos> so they can just deal with it
23:56:43<KitaFox> Kita doesn't think it is okay to wish violence towards anyone.
23:56:44<KitaFox> :<
23:57:00<Laevos> Me neither, but I think it's fine to sing about it
23:57:28<Laevos> black metal wouldn't be the same about lyrics describing raping Jesus with a crucifix, etc.
23:57:36<Laevos> I mean rly
23:57:41<KitaFox> Yeah, as long as they don't actually believe it is okay to do it... And some of them do. And that isn't okay. But, not all of them do. Most of them probably don't.
23:57:43<Laevos> at that point why even bother
23:57:58<KitaFox> Black Metal about physics.
23:57:59<KitaFox> :3
23:58:05<Laevos> there is some
23:58:13<Laevos> surprising to nobody, it's TOTAL SHIT
23:58:15<Laevos> :c
23:58:19<KitaFox> WELL
23:58:23<KitaFox> MAKE IT BETTER
23:58:28<Laevos> no
23:58:37<Laevos> black metal is beautiful in its tradition
23:58:48<KitaFox> Tradition is dumb. Massacre tradition.
23:58:52<Laevos> people who want to 'progress' the genre are full of themselves
23:58:58 KitaFox: begins vandlising a bible.
23:59:01<Laevos> black metal isn't about progress
23:59:08<Laevos> it's regressive music
23:59:26<Laevos> which makes nazis think that it's okay to latch on
23:59:27<KitaFox> Yeah, but that doesn't mean we can't play with it.
23:59:29<Laevos> they're wrong
23:59:38 KitaFox: plays with everything.
23:59:49<KitaFox> INDUSTRIAL SYMPHONY STEP
23:59:49<Laevos> their philosophy is no less weak than Christianity
--- Day changed Sun May 04 2014
00:00:13<Laevos> much more so, even
00:00:20 KitaFox: finds music more fascinating in theory than she does in practice.
00:00:31 Laevos: doesn't
00:01:41 KitaFox: is also obsessively into Pokemon battling...
00:01:46<KitaFox> And game design...
00:01:53<KitaFox> And incrementor games...
00:01:56<KitaFox> See a pattern?
00:02:03<Laevos> dunno, is there one?
00:02:11<KitaFox> Logic, structure, systems...
00:02:18<KitaFox> The ability to build.
00:02:22<KitaFox> Rules.
00:02:44<KitaFox> They help Kita make sense of a world she could not understand before, because she was insane.
00:03:05<Laevos> Yeah
00:04:25<Laevos> that's okay
00:04:28<KitaFox> People talk about chaos and lack of structure like it is cool and achieveable...
00:05:01<KitaFox> WHEN YOUR CHAIR ATTEMPTS TO EAT YOU AND YOUR NOSE BECOMES A METAPHYSICAL CONCEPT, IT ISN'T SO FUCKING FUN
00:05:04 KitaFox: collapses.
00:05:05<KitaFox> ;.;
00:05:17 KitaFox: shivers.
00:05:21<Laevos> sorry, dear...
00:05:25<KitaFox> Kita never wants to go back to that...
00:05:26<Laevos> I'm home now
00:05:57<KitaFox> Kita needs to bake cookies.
00:06:06<KitaFox> Cookies are structured. They have a formula.
00:06:13<KitaFox> There are no surprises with cookies.
00:06:14<KitaFox> ;.;
00:06:33<Laevos> <3...
00:06:50 KitaFox: gets nose-to-nose with Lilith...
00:06:55<KitaFox> Do not be like Kita.
00:07:04<KitaFox> No matter what...
00:07:18<KitaFox> Always make sure that your chairs stay chairs, and your nose stays a nose.
00:07:32<Laevos> I don't think that'll be much of an issue for me...
00:08:03<KitaFox> Never, ever take it for granted.
00:08:08<KitaFox> Alright?
00:08:12<Laevos> Okay <3
00:08:21<KitaFox> True chaos is the most terrifying thing ever.
00:08:40<KitaFox> You think people don't care about you, or that they ignore you?
00:08:47<KitaFox> Chaos truly doesn't care.
00:08:54<KitaFox> But it always cares.
00:09:03<KitaFox> It is always, and never fucking with you.
00:09:15<KitaFox> Nothing and everything stays the same.
00:09:27<KitaFox> You can't know what that feels like.
00:09:30<KitaFox> It breaks you.
00:09:47<KitaFox> it broke Kita
00:10:03<KitaFox> she stared into the everending void
00:10:12<KitaFox> and it babbled to kita
00:10:21<KitaFox> qrxlflb

00:10:40<Laevos> I'm sorry, dear...
00:10:48<KitaFox> QRXLFLB
00:11:12<KitaFox> KWURCKSELFLIIB
00:11:30<KitaFox> Kita knows nothing scarier than that combination of letters
00:11:56<Laevos> the back of my head feels pressurized like when I was on those meds
00:12:09<KitaFox> Then maybe it wasn't the meds
00:12:21<KitaFox> Maybe it was because you fell and hit your head.
00:13:58<Laevos> maybe
00:15:08 KitaFox: fidgits.
00:18:49<Laevos> trying to cry
00:19:15<Laevos> I'm so lonely...
00:19:55<KitaFox> Kita loves Lilith.
00:20:09<Laevos> love you too
00:21:05<Laevos> please help me... somebody help me...

13:28:30<Laevos> did you use some magical Goddess spells on me?

13:32:57<KitaFox> <3

15:15:50<KitaFox> Funny thing about Gen III remakes.
15:15:54<Laevos> Yes?
15:16:07<KitaFox> Ever since HG/SS Kita has been stating that they were not going to happen.
15:20:39<Laevos> o:
15:20:53<KitaFox> So

20:06:23<Laevos> Got my messages?
20:06:27<Laevos> just in case
20:06:28<Laevos> [20:05:10] <Laevos> Lilith doesn't really have the urge to ask girls out, really... used to ask guys out, that was super fun >n>
20:06:28<Laevos> [20:05:26] <Laevos> "lol u kno im st8 rite?"
20:07:33<KitaFox> o.o
20:07:35<KitaFox> st8?
20:07:43<Laevos> *str8
20:07:51<KitaFox> X3
20:08:03<KitaFox> The proper response to that...
20:08:13<KitaFox> "Oh. Alright, sorry to bother you, then."
20:08:21<Laevos> That's generally what I did
20:08:30<Laevos> (and proceeded to crawl off and sob)
20:08:54<KitaFox> :<
20:09:03<Laevos> Yep, life is hard
20:09:04<Laevos> etc.
20:10:15<Laevos> But that was long ago, anyway
20:10:43<Laevos> before I knew of the glory of lesbian foxgoddesses >u>
20:11:03<Laevos> and the worship thereof~! :'3
20:11:38<KitaFox> XP
20:11:52<Laevos> It's true~!
20:14:51<Laevos> Does Kita ever ask people out? ;n;
20:15:07<KitaFox> All the time
20:15:10<Laevos> :3
20:15:19<Laevos> Kita can ask Lilith out whenever she wants~ ;u;
20:15:24<KitaFox> X3
20:15:33<Laevos> easier to do such things online for me o:
20:15:36<Laevos> well 'ask out'
20:15:47<Laevos> rather loose application of the term >w>
20:20:15<KitaFox> X3
20:20:41<Laevos> G-Goddess? D-Do you want to, maybe, watch a movie together sometime... or something? ;/////////////////;
20:20:52<KitaFox> Well sure.
20:20:55<KitaFox> That'd be lovely.
20:21:04<KitaFox> What movie do you have in mind?
20:21:26<Laevos> Hmm... what kinds of movies does Kita like? o:
20:21:49<KitaFox> Kita likes intense films.
20:21:56<KitaFox> Films with direction and power.
20:22:19<KitaFox> (This normally translates to comedic action films, or just over the top action films.)
20:22:31<KitaFox> But Primer fits this category.
20:22:47<KitaFox> It was intense. There was direction. The idea of the film is powerful.
20:22:49<Laevos> Hmmmm, INTENSE, eh?
20:23:00<KitaFox> Crank and Crank 2.
20:23:01<KitaFox> :P
20:23:08<Laevos> Never seen those o:
20:23:20<KitaFox> Comedic action films with Jason Statham.
20:23:35<Laevos> I think I might have seen previews... O:
20:23:36<Laevos> o:
20:23:50<KitaFox> First movie: He is injected with a synthetic drug and must keep his adrenaline up to stay alive.
20:24:35<KitaFox> Second movie: He is given an artificial heart and must keep charging it to stay alive.
20:24:42<KitaFox> Both times, he is out for revenge.
20:24:54<KitaFox> (Or reveangance, if you're a MGS fan.)
20:25:34<Laevos> Heheheh xD
20:25:36<Laevos> Saw that being played, at least
20:26:15<KitaFox> Crank is hilarious.
20:26:20<KitaFox> Crank 2 is as well.
20:26:28<Laevos> :3
20:26:32<Laevos> Dunno if it's my thing, hahaha xD
20:26:40<Laevos> Have you seen the original Ghost in the Shell movie? o:
20:26:48 KitaFox: blinks.
20:26:55<KitaFox> Kita has seen the series... >>;;
20:27:08<Laevos> But I mean the '90s movie
20:27:10<KitaFox> But didn't really like it, much. Never watched the movie as a result.
20:27:34<Laevos> Hmm... depending on what you didn't like about the series, you might still be able to enjoy the original movie
20:27:41<Laevos> it's a bit different than what came after it
20:27:49<KitaFox> Yeah, Kita has heard that.
20:29:04<Laevos> The English voice acting is pretty painful, really
20:29:09<Laevos> but it was the '90s \(o.o)/
20:29:16<Laevos> and Lilith has the DVD with Japanese audio so
20:29:20<Laevos> can do either one >u>
20:31:16<Laevos> If you want, I mean ;w;
20:31:37<KitaFox> Well
20:31:43<KitaFox> Kita needs more than one choice!
20:31:59<Laevos> Okay okay!
20:32:03<Laevos> Lilith also has...
20:32:15<Laevos> hmm maybe Kita wouldn't like that one as much... xD
20:32:35<Laevos> a movie called "Rubber's Lover"
20:32:47<KitaFox> o.x
20:32:53<Laevos> very strange Japanese movie from the '90s
20:32:58<Laevos> live action
20:33:02<KitaFox> Strange
20:33:03<Laevos> not one of them there animus
20:33:19<Laevos> hmm... trying to think of what I haven't seen that I'd like to...
20:33:26<Laevos> What are Kita's thoughts on horror movies?
20:33:44<KitaFox> Most are either unintentionally hilarious, or just bad.
20:33:55<Laevos> hrrrrmles ;w;
20:34:01<KitaFox> Notable exceptions are Rob Zombie's Halloween, and Cabin in the Woods.
20:34:28<Laevos> Cabin in the Woods was cool, yo
20:34:34<KitaFox> Yush
20:34:39<KitaFox> It was very, very good.
20:34:57<Laevos> I liked it ;u;
20:37:59<KitaFox> Oh
20:38:07<KitaFox> The Cube was interesting.
20:38:25<Laevos> Hmm... don't think I've seen that one
20:38:40<KitaFox> It is what Saw wishes it was.
20:40:31<Laevos> Oh okay

19:21:02<KitaFox> Gen III and Gen V are the only gens to change Champions in their respective second releases.
19:21:14<KitaFox> (Emerald and B2W2)
19:21:32<KitaFox> Steven was a fan favourite, and Wallace was disliked because he was flamboyant.
19:21:39<Laevos> Aww :c
19:21:55<KitaFox> (This was back in the early Aughts, when kids still thought it was cool to hate gay people.)
19:22:12<Laevos> Yeah
19:22:33<KitaFox> And flamboyancy was equated with gay.
19:22:42<Laevos> Also yes ;n;
19:23:24<KitaFox> So when it wasn't okay to hate him for being flamboyant, they kept the hate, and justified with a myriad of reasons...

03:19:09<KitaFox> Totally not worth the money
03:19:11<Laevos> $$$$
03:19:36<KitaFox> You should whore yourself out to conservative politicians.
03:19:57<KitaFox> That's where the money is at, sweettits.
03:20:09<KitaFox> I'm so drunk and tired.
03:22:37<Laevos> :3

23:24:47Irssi: Starting query in esper with KitaFox
23:24:47<KitaFox> BitCoin is regulated by mtGox
23:25:05<KitaFox> It isn't a hard regulatory system...
23:25:08<Laevos> And that's been working out so well for them, has it?
23:25:32<Laevos> It sounds to me like more of a clusterfuck.
23:25:36<KitaFox> Nor is it very stable... But BitCoin is the FIRST cryptocurrency, and was going to rely on the morality of the people using it.
23:25:44<Laevos> lol
23:26:01<KitaFox> Dogecoin is much better contained, and the people using it care about looking positive to people, instead of looking fruitful.
23:26:13<Laevos> And, again, who's going to regulate it?
23:26:22<Laevos> Some non-governmental entity?
23:26:41<KitaFox> So charity work, lack of illegal activites, and the acceleration worth is what they are working towards.
23:27:10<KitaFox> But right now, they are too small to require strict regulation, though they are working on developing a hub.
23:27:15<Laevos> :/
23:27:24<KitaFox> Learning from the mistakes of mtGox
23:27:44<Laevos> Currency should be regulated by the governing body of the political entity that uses it.
23:27:53<Laevos> The /governing/ body.
23:27:56<KitaFox> You trust the government?
23:28:03<Laevos> More than I do any company. c:
23:28:05<KitaFox> They still won't let Kita get married.
23:28:14<KitaFox> Google supports Gay Marriage.
23:28:18<Laevos> lol
23:28:22<Laevos> I don't support companies
23:28:26<KitaFox> The government doesn't mind evolutionary theory denial.
23:28:28<Laevos> y'know, that whole capitalism thing?
23:28:35<KitaFox> Google has a Darwin Day.
23:28:41<Laevos> the government needs better people in it, yes
23:28:45<Laevos> but that's the thing
23:28:57<Laevos> we live in a democratic system by which individual rule can be shifted, if slowly
23:29:00<KitaFox> And most companies need better people in them, too.
23:29:05<Laevos> companies have no such system.
23:29:14<Laevos> Thus, the government option will always be better in the long run.
23:29:18<KitaFox> Doesn't make all of them bad.
23:29:31<Laevos> No, but it makes them less trustworthy by default
23:29:40<Laevos> certainly never trustworthy of running an entire fucking currency.
23:29:44<KitaFox> And if government becomes dictatorship or oppressive oligarchy? Then there is no way to shift in, unless you revolt.
23:29:55 Laevos: rolls her eyes
23:30:00<Laevos> We live in the 21st century, dear.
23:30:07<Laevos> In the Western world.
23:30:10<Laevos> That's not happening.
23:30:44<Laevos> I 100% believe in centralized power
23:31:10<Laevos> in giving more authority to the central government, and getting it away from companies, away from people whose job it is to win profits, not public opinion.
23:31:21<Laevos> The role of the state should never be to turn a profit
23:31:28<Laevos> if they do, they're doing something terribly, terribly wrong.
23:31:34<KitaFox> Dictatorships (North Korea, Saudi Arabia, The Congo) and oppressive oligarchies (China, Russia, Egypt) didn't happen over night, and didn't happen with the support of the world. They happened slowly, by shifting political power with money.
23:31:42<Laevos> Some things need to run on a deficit.
23:31:53<Laevos> lol
23:32:06<Laevos> You really can't compare the western world to any of those places with a straight face
23:32:17<KitaFox> Russia and America
23:32:25<Laevos> there's been too much progress made to make that realistic outside of the realm of the most insane conspiracy theorist.
23:32:37<Laevos> Your paranoia is showing.
23:32:43<KitaFox> American politicians care more about money than public opinion.
23:32:46<KitaFox> For certain.
23:33:04<Laevos> Showing that we need more leftists in power. c:
23:33:15<Laevos> Actual leftists, mind, not center-right democrats.
23:33:30<KitaFox> In a forced two party system?
23:33:42<Laevos> I know, I know, it's a long time coming.
23:33:47<Laevos> But look at Seattle, for instance
23:33:48<KitaFox> That would require massive activism in favour of independant candidates.
23:34:02<KitaFox> And they are trying to kill the biggest engine of activism we've ever had.
23:34:09<KitaFox> (The internet)
23:34:23<Laevos> Not independent
23:34:34<KitaFox> Non-affiliated.
23:34:44<KitaFox> independant, not Independant
23:35:02<Laevos> I have faith
23:35:23<Laevos> The fact that someone like Kshama Sawant has gotten into office gives me faith.
23:35:36<KitaFox> Kita dislikes faith.
23:35:49<KitaFox> Faith is an awful thing. It is so easily twisted and distorted...
23:35:54<Laevos> :3
23:35:58<KitaFox> Kita would never want faith.
23:36:12<KitaFox> Her followers would appreciate her on facts and merits.
23:36:14<KitaFox> Not faith.
23:36:15<Laevos> Kita doesn't seem to need something to keep her from fucking killing herself from day to day.
23:36:30<KitaFox> Kita can see good in life, for now.
23:36:33<Laevos> So you'd be kind to excuse that particular weakness in me.
23:36:49<KitaFox> Kita looks forward to talking to Lilith every day.
23:37:13<Laevos> Then you'd better be glad that Lilith doesn't rely on logic to give her hope for the future.
23:37:28<Laevos> Her internal logic reminds her day to day that she should die as quickly as possible.
23:37:55<KitaFox> Your logic is poor, and grounded in fallacy. Kita wants to fix that.
23:38:04<Laevos> You think so, huh?
23:38:13<KitaFox> You base your idea on the implied fact that you are bad.
23:38:26<KitaFox> But there is no empirical proof that you arebad.
23:38:27<Laevos> That's just an aside, really.
23:38:34<KitaFox> Implied facts are fallacy.
23:38:51<Laevos> It's not the main reason I should die
23:38:58<Laevos> it's to avoid a greater pain
23:39:13<Laevos> that of continuing to live to see the tenuous charade I've built around myself fall apart
23:39:17<Laevos> it already has in one area
23:39:23<Laevos> and I can see the cracks where it will continue to do so.
23:39:43<KitaFox> To believe that greater pain is an inevitability is also fallacious.
23:40:00<Laevos> To not believe it would be a level of naivete that I am not really capable of.
23:40:05<KitaFox> You're implying that greater pain is the guaranteed result. Another implied fact.
23:40:11<Laevos> I pretend not to believe it.
23:40:23<Laevos> That's part of that faith
23:40:26<Laevos> but I know.
23:40:33<Laevos> The logical part of my mind knows
23:40:33<KitaFox> There is also the opportunity for excessive good.
23:40:45<Laevos> is capable of seeing quite clearly where the things I've set myself up for will lead
23:40:52<KitaFox> Would Kita not count as an excessive good?
23:41:09<KitaFox> And Kita was a random event, to Lilith.
23:41:39<Laevos> sometimes I wonder
23:41:49<Laevos> caring about people is dangerous
23:41:58<Laevos> it's only because I care about you that you're so very able to hurt me
23:42:12<Laevos> to give me panic attacks and make me collapse into myself into a pathetic heap
23:42:21<Laevos> I wouldn't have such a reaction if I didn't give a shit what you thought
23:42:24<Laevos> but clearly
23:42:27<Laevos> it's too late for that
23:43:08<KitaFox> Part of why you care is because you know Kita is right.
23:43:18<KitaFox> The other part is because you love her.
23:44:10<Laevos> Kita's right about some things, wrong about others.  
23:44:39<KitaFox> Kita's right about Lilith's broken logic.
23:44:59<Laevos> Kita doesn't have sufficient information to make that claim.
23:45:01<KitaFox> And unfortunately, foundation must be broken before a new construction can be placed.
23:45:27<KitaFox> Based on what Kita does have?
23:45:36<KitaFox> Kita is right.
23:45:55<Laevos> and what foundation do you intend to replace?
23:46:32<KitaFox> The foundation of pessimism.
23:46:58<KitaFox> With a foundation of realism. Realism allows for optimism.
23:47:20<KitaFox> Lilith needs more happy thoughts.
23:47:40<Laevos> Kita would have to drug me to induce such in my brain.
23:47:46<Laevos> perhaps that's your intent
23:48:04<KitaFox> Kita is capable of doing so without actually using drugs. She has proven that.
23:48:20<Laevos> maybe i shouldn't talk to you anymore
23:48:24<Laevos> it might be too dangerous
23:48:32<Laevos> before i got like this
23:48:36<Laevos> i was feeling relaly good about myself
23:48:40<Laevos> my hair looked really pretty
23:48:48<KitaFox> Or, it might be what saves you.
23:48:49<Laevos> i took a selfie even though i'm not very good tai it
23:48:57<Laevos> and i wsaaas goign to show you
23:49:00<Laevos> but now i want to die
23:49:04<KitaFox> Well good. You should feel good about yourself.
23:49:05<KitaFox> :<
23:49:05<Laevos> more than i have in a while
23:49:09<Laevos> i don't anymore
23:49:19<KitaFox> Kita wants Lilith to feel good about herself.
23:49:22<Laevos> iidon't feel pretty anymore
23:49:24<Laevos> the momen'ts gone
23:49:55<Laevos> and now i have an overdue library book
23:49:56<Laevos> fuck
23:50:18<Laevos> i imghas well just fucking die
23:50:20<KitaFox> Hey, don't let the feelings stack.
23:50:25<Laevos> tooooo late
23:50:25<KitaFox> Deal with them separately.
23:50:33<KitaFox> Compounding them is what makes you feel bad.
23:50:35<Laevos> mybrain doesn't work liket hat
23:50:41<KitaFox> It could.
23:50:46<Laevos> that'swrong
23:50:54<KitaFox> You're stuck with what is instinctual.
23:51:01<Laevos> i knowwww 100% of  my brain
23:51:05<Laevos> and it doesn't work liiiike that
23:51:06<KitaFox> As a human, you have the power to defy your instinct.
23:51:31<Laevos> nobody knows more about me than i do, t ha'ts while that's why i won't talk to a therapist
23:51:36<Laevos> because they won't know
23:52:18<KitaFox> They can't know unless you tell them.
23:52:26<KitaFox> And if you know, why can't you tell them
23:52:41<Laevos> beecasue i don't trust htem
23:53:09<Laevos> because they''ll try to put me on drugs liiiiike that fucking dockktor
23:53:20<KitaFox> They thought it would help.
23:53:25<KitaFox> They wanted to help you.
23:53:28<Laevos> shww as fucking wrong
23:53:36<Laevos> it made it worse and i've felt worse eversssince
23:53:40<KitaFox> That doesn't make them bad.
23:53:49<KitaFox> Yeah? But it is out of your system.
23:53:59<Laevos> dosen't fleel like it
23:54:00<KitaFox> In fact, it never had a chance to really work.
23:54:09<Laevos> my brain knew what it was
23:54:12<Laevos> and it's punishing me
23:54:15<Laevos> it's still punishing me
23:54:19<Laevos> becauase i messed up
23:54:19<KitaFox> SSRIs require a system buildup.
23:54:25<Laevos> i put something bad in me
23:54:31<KitaFox> You can't actually feel affects within 24 hours.
23:54:33<KitaFox> SHUT UP
23:54:38<Laevos> something very bad
23:54:40<Laevos> disgusting
23:54:43<Laevos> bad

23:54:55<Laevos> bad
23:54:59<Laevos> bad...
23:55:00 KitaFox: grabs Lilith and puts her hand over her mouth.
23:55:01<KitaFox> Quit.
23:55:03<Laevos> and it'll never go away
23:55:07<Laevos> now it'll neve get taken back
23:55:08<Laevos> never ever
23:55:12<Laevos> i'll never get that back
23:55:16<Laevos> what i had before
23:55:16<KitaFox> You're only compounding the emotions and making it worse.
23:55:19<Laevos> never again
23:55:24<Laevos> it's tolate
23:55:29<Laevos> ssjit
23:55:33<Laevos> sithtsthi
23:55:34<Laevos> shit
23:55:48<Laevos> i lost
23:56:00<KitaFox> If you keep putting it on that pedestal, then no. You won't.
23:56:08<KitaFox> But that stuff never did ANYTHING to you.
23:56:16<Laevos> doesn't matter if it did or not
23:56:19<KitaFox> Your body couldn't even process it right.
23:56:20<Laevos> it's me im mad at
23:56:28<Laevos> i'm punishing me
23:56:33<KitaFox> Why? For trying to help yourself?
23:56:44<Laevos> i put it inside mee
23:56:49<Laevos> i've enever felt so violated
23:56:50<KitaFox> You were HELPING yourself.
23:56:53<Laevos> so dirty
23:57:01<KitaFox> It didn't do anything.
23:57:06<KitaFox> And even if it had?
23:57:14<KitaFox> The stuff in there is ALREADY IN YOUR BODY.
23:57:19<Laevos> i've let so amany guys use my body t o cum and tha'ts the dirstiest i've ever felt
23:57:27<Laevos> taking those little blue
23:57:27<Laevos> bad
23:57:28<Laevos> tings
23:57:29<KitaFox> You weren't introducing anything new.
23:57:42<KitaFox> You've been producing that chemical your entire life.
23:57:49<KitaFox> Just not doing it correctly.
23:58:01<Laevos> i never felt like i've been so dirty, so disgussting, like more of a slut than when i gave in
23:58:03<Laevos> and took them
23:58:06<Laevos> for two days
23:58:15<Laevos> two hooowhole tdays of distasteful
23:58:23<Laevos> horrible...
23:58:48<Laevos> im biting me now
23:59:55<Laevos> ishoduld just eatmyself so i disssapipear and join the rest of the filth in shit inside ofme
--- Day changed Sat May 17 2014
00:00:10<KitaFox> Go to bed.
00:00:39<KitaFox> You're nonfunctional, like this.
00:00:41<KitaFox> Go to bed.
00:00:55<Laevos> thiis''' is why. why i'll neeever tell them. they'll get tired of listening and send me away
00:01:09<KitaFox> No.
00:01:15<Laevos> just
00:01:16<KitaFox> That is not why Kita is doing this.
00:01:18<Laevos> like you
00:01:19<Laevos> just
00:01:21<Laevos> like everyone
00:01:31<Laevos> 'you're too much go away'
00:01:33<KitaFox> If you keep going on like this, you are going to hurt yourself.
00:01:36<Laevos> just like everyone
00:01:39<Laevos> good
00:01:41<Laevos> i should hurt
00:01:41<Laevos> me
00:01:47<KitaFox> Kita wants to stop Lilith from hurting herself.
00:01:59<Laevos> ii shoulb brin g pain to 
00:01:59<Laevos> me
00:02:01<KitaFox> And she does this by telling Lilith to go to bed.
00:02:06<KitaFox> Where she will go to sleep.
00:02:10<KitaFox> And wake up
00:02:18<KitaFox> And the feelings will be less severe.
00:02:27<KitaFox> And she will be less likely to hurt herself.
00:02:27<Laevos> iwanna......... pull out m y hair
00:02:28<Laevos> so
00:02:30<KitaFox> Understood
00:02:30<Laevos> i feel really ugly
00:02:32<Laevos> and so
00:02:36<Laevos> i'll hate mysel fso much that
00:02:38<Laevos> i kill myself
00:02:40 KitaFox: cups her chin
00:02:56<KitaFox> You need to sleep.
00:03:03<Laevos> iii wish i had the resolve to stab myself to death
00:03:15<KitaFox> You won't feel great when you wake up, but you won't feel anywhere near as bad.
00:03:18<Laevos> but id'not
00:03:33<KitaFox> And when you're like this, there is nothing Kita can do or say to fix it.
00:04:12<KitaFox> So Lilith should be a good girl
00:04:18<KitaFox> And she should go to bed.
00:04:35<KitaFox> So that later, when Lilith is calm...
00:04:39<Laevos> i wanna be ag od girl...
00:04:40<KitaFox> Kita can explain things to her.
00:04:57<KitaFox> Good.
00:05:03<KitaFox> Get some water, and then go to bed.
00:05:15<Laevos> but i'll hurt fewer people if i'm dead..
00:05:53<KitaFox> You're going to go to bed, and then take care of the Library book in the morning.
00:06:16<Laevos> ca't move
00:06:18<Laevos> body isn't obeying
00:06:49<KitaFox> On the count of three, you are going to get up.
00:06:54<KitaFox> One.
00:06:56<KitaFox> Two.
00:07:00<KitaFox> Three.
00:07:02<KitaFox> Now stand.

00:07:20<Laevos> ignore me
00:07:22<Laevos> and it'll be like

00:07:34<KitaFox> No. Be a good kitty.

00:07:39 KitaFox: rubs her ears.
00:07:40<KitaFox> Come on.
00:07:47<Laevos> can't move...
00:07:59<KitaFox> Saying you can't will only make it ture.
00:08:10<Laevos> it alrreaeddy was..
00:08:18<Laevos> it's too ltae
00:08:30 KitaFox: rubs her teeth.
00:08:36<Laevos> im stuck here

00:08:52 KitaFox: keeps petting.
00:08:53<Laevos> i am
00:08:54<Laevos> and

00:09:14<Laevos> i promised three different people i'd drive out to them in two weeks
00:09:29<KitaFox> Who
00:09:31<Laevos> on all different parts of the world
00:09:33<Laevos> i
00:09:33<Laevos> lied
00:09:41<Laevos> i won't be able to go anywhere
00:09:44<KitaFox> Okay
00:09:50<Laevos> i thought imight
00:10:01<Laevos> i never said no when they askeed
00:10:08<KitaFox> Just tell them something came up, and you have to cancel.
00:10:35<Laevos> thadt'd hurt them
00:10:37<Laevos> which'll
00:10:39<Laevos> happen either way
00:10:51<KitaFox> Lets go for minimal damage, alright?
00:11:20<Laevos> minimal damage woul d have been me knowing in the first place not to accept three invitatinos for the same week when i knew full well
00:11:30<KitaFox> Nono.
00:11:39<KitaFox> Stop right there.
00:11:40<Laevos> i knew
00:11:45<Laevos> i knew exactly what i was doing
00:11:45<KitaFox> Right now is not back then.
00:11:47<Laevos> i knew i was lying
00:11:48<KitaFox> Now come on
00:11:51<KitaFox> Minimal damage.
00:12:11<Laevos> minimal damage would be me not being such a slut
00:12:13<KitaFox> Don't care about that. Care about fixing the immediate problem. We can work on that one later.
00:12:35<KitaFox> (Kita will care about the big problem in the future, promise.)
00:13:25<Laevos> i need people
00:13:28<Laevos> to be close to
00:13:33<Laevos> and i hvae nobody
00:13:40<Laevos> that doesn'trequire me to
00:13:50<Laevos> go through financially and sometimes physically damagin gtrials
00:13:55<Laevos> to be with them
00:13:59<KitaFox> Yes, and you shoot down EVERY proposal Kita offers.
00:14:11<Laevos> like hwat/
00:14:16<Laevos> not needing people anyore?
00:14:25<KitaFox> Like going out and meeting people.
00:14:31<KitaFox> And her suggestions for such.
00:14:40<Laevos> suggestions that wouldn't work
00:14:42<Laevos> because i know me
00:14:47<Laevos> if there was a way out I'd alreayd know
00:15:14<KitaFox> No, you wouldn't.
00:15:19<KitaFox> You don't know everything.
00:15:27<Laevos> I know everything about me
00:15:45<KitaFox> But not everything about anyone else.
00:16:04<KitaFox> And therefore, your data is incomplete, and you cannot conclude without trials.
00:16:18<Laevos> I'll just find them disdainful
00:16:21<Laevos> no
00:16:22<Laevos> that's not it
00:16:32<Laevos> other way around almost
00:16:43<Laevos> I'll want to be friends with them, find interesting people
00:16:47<Laevos> and then I know what'll happen
00:16:53<Laevos> if it's physical communication
00:16:55<Laevos> I KNOW
00:17:00<Laevos> because it's what always happens
00:17:28<Laevos> I'll be too quiet, I won't initiate, I won't be able to communicate. I'll be boring, uninteresting, not even a side-note, not even a footnote on the summary of the event.
00:17:31<KitaFox> No, you don't. The interesting thing about people is that the normal, unbroken people have the capacity to behave spontaneously and abnormally.
00:17:32<Laevos> And I'll go unnoticed
00:17:41<Laevos> because 
00:17:44<Laevos> in person
00:17:48<Laevos> I'm fucking boring.
00:18:03<Laevos> I don't get bored, so I
00:18:09<Laevos> don't have any way to help people avoid theirs
00:18:10<Laevos> in person
00:18:41<KitaFox> You're only boring because you're depressed.
00:19:02<KitaFox> Depressed people don't feel bored. Only crushing despair, annihilating despair, and regular despair.
00:19:21<Laevos> knowing why doesn't change the fact.
00:19:39<KitaFox> You can become undepressed.
00:19:41<Laevos> I can only connect with people when I can use text
00:19:46<KitaFox> Depression is fixable.
00:19:46<Laevos> and I can only use text when people are far away
00:20:31<KitaFox> You're not hopeless
00:20:52<Laevos> when I was a little piece of jailbait, a man wanted to buy me a plane ticket to be his live-in houseboy/fucktoy
00:21:01<Laevos> I wonder if I'd have done more net good if I'd accepted
00:21:04<Laevos> and just
00:21:05<Laevos> disappeared

00:34:04<Laevos> [00:31:48] <Laevos> They were the only ones I could open up to
00:34:05<Laevos> [00:31:52] <Laevos> I don't have that with anyone now
00:34:05<Laevos> [00:31:54] <Laevos> at least
00:34:05<Laevos> [00:31:59] <Laevos> not anyone that I can do it physically with
00:34:05<Laevos> [00:32:00] <Laevos> well...
00:34:05<Laevos> [00:32:04] <Laevos> I couldn't /really/ open up to them
00:34:05<Laevos> [00:32:07] <Laevos> not say how I really felt
00:34:05<Laevos> [00:32:19] <Laevos> but I could be a person who spoke and participated in conversations
00:34:05<Laevos> [00:33:15] <Laevos> my brief reprises from that are when I hang out with people I've met online first
00:34:05<Laevos> [00:33:18] <Laevos> but that's so expensive
00:34:05<Laevos> [00:33:29] <Laevos> and I can't do it often enough for how much human contact I need to stay healthy
00:35:50 KitaFox: slowly strokes her hair...
00:36:12<Laevos> I have nothing, Kita...
00:36:13<KitaFox> As much as you hate most hubs of social interaction...
00:36:16<Laevos> how am I supposed to go on like this?
00:36:18<KitaFox> You need to find one that works.
00:36:25<KitaFox> One that is just tolerable enough.
00:37:24<Laevos> I hate vacations from school
00:37:31<Laevos> I usually spend them laying in bed most of the time
00:37:32<Laevos> in the past
00:37:38<Laevos> that was mainly interrupted by
00:37:41<Laevos> friends wanting to do things
00:37:46<Laevos> it's going to be so much worse now...
00:38:47<KitaFox> You should make friends in your classes.
00:38:54<KitaFox> This is a future solution.
00:38:58<Laevos> I can't seem to...
00:39:03<Laevos> there have been people I thought were cool
00:39:06<Laevos> especially in my WGSS class
00:39:21<Laevos> but I could never talk to any of them
00:39:24<Laevos> no matter how much I wanted
00:39:50<Laevos> and the people that did come close to being my friends this year...?
00:39:51<Laevos> Graduated.
00:40:00<Laevos> I will never
00:40:01<Laevos> see them
00:40:01<Laevos> again
00:40:17<KitaFox> No way to stay in contact?
00:42:14<Laevos> Do you know how pathetic it'll look if I just randomly message them on Facebook?
00:42:16<Laevos> No, no way.
00:42:35<KitaFox> Pathetic?
00:42:49<Laevos> yes
00:42:52<Laevos> desperate for contact
00:42:54<Laevos> which I am
00:43:01<Laevos> I have no justifiable reason to message them
00:43:03<Laevos> it'd appear unusual
00:43:06<Laevos> I don't do that
00:43:20<KitaFox> So?
00:43:25<KitaFox> You could if you wanted to.
00:43:32<Laevos> to what effect?
00:43:38<KitaFox> Maybe being friends?
00:43:39<Laevos> Just to feel the sting of being rejected?
00:43:47<Laevos> They're moving on
00:43:50<Laevos> with their lives
00:43:57<Laevos> no room for people like me who've lagged behind
00:44:11<KitaFox> Doesn't mean you can't just shoot a message to them.
00:44:13<Laevos> "I'm desperate for human contact" is not something that people are very receptive to
00:44:16<Laevos> it's creepy.'
00:44:24<KitaFox> Then don't say that.
00:44:26<Laevos> I'm not going to be like that... to do that...
00:44:30<Laevos> but it'd be true...
00:44:42<Laevos> I feel like I shouldn't be allowed to talk to people when I'm this desperate to do so
00:44:45<KitaFox> Say something else that is true.
00:45:14<Laevos> I'd feel immoral... asking them to v_v
00:45:42<KitaFox> If they never know that you're desperate, then you can eventually alleviate the feeling.
00:45:53<Laevos> It's not an issue of them knowing or not...
00:46:02<Laevos> I would know
00:46:07<Laevos> which is why I can't do it
00:46:09<Laevos> which is why I don't do it
00:46:25<Laevos> won't
00:46:29<KitaFox> Lilith
00:46:34<KitaFox> Lilith... babe.
00:46:49<KitaFox> Let's stay calm, alright?
00:47:06<KitaFox> Let's NOT get worked into a tizzy, again.
00:47:21<Laevos> sorry
00:47:40<KitaFox> It isn't good for you to get that worked up, alright?
00:47:51<Laevos> I know, I deserve to feel like shit because I don't do anything proactive about it because I can't bring myself to
00:47:54<Laevos> it's all my fault
00:47:55<Laevos> I get 
00:48:02<Laevos> it
00:48:18<KitaFox> We're working on that, babe.
00:48:30<KitaFox> You don't deserve to feel bad.
00:48:39<KitaFox> You can't really help that you feel bad, right now.
00:48:48<KitaFox> But we can control the future, a little bit.
00:49:09<Laevos> I wish I could come over
00:49:13<Laevos> I just want to be held right now
00:49:16<Laevos> crying so much
00:49:31<KitaFox> Make sure that you drink some water, if you're crying.
00:49:47<Laevos> I already got into bed...
00:49:55<Laevos> I don't have the strength to get up again
00:50:27<KitaFox> Not now, but don't let yourself get dehydrated, alright?
00:50:44<Laevos> please hold me...
00:50:59 KitaFox: hugs tight and rubs on her ears.
00:51:15<Laevos> I wish you really could...
00:52:32<Laevos> please don't hate me...
00:52:44<KitaFox> Kita doesn't hate Lilith.
00:52:58<KitaFox> Kita does think that Lilith should work on staying calm.
00:53:07<Laevos> it's so hard...
00:53:14<Laevos> I do my best...
00:53:16<KitaFox> It is.
00:53:27<KitaFox> We're gonna work on making your best, better.
00:53:32<KitaFox> Like working muscles.

01:06:35<KitaFox> Maybe you should spend more time with your bro.
01:06:42<Laevos> I took a picture

01:08:28<KitaFox> Seriously, though.
01:08:32<KitaFox> You. Your brother.
01:08:37<KitaFox> That human interaction.
01:08:40<KitaFox> Just keep it PG.
01:09:12<Laevos> I spend time with him when he has time for me...
01:09:21<Laevos> He's not such a recluse like I was in high school.
01:09:37<KitaFox> :3
01:11:21<Laevos> my family is all I have, really...
01:11:38<KitaFox> That isn't bad, if they don't suck.
01:11:59<Laevos> they don't
01:12:11<Laevos> I'm glad that I have my siblings and mom
01:12:15<Laevos> I didn't mean that it was bad

02:21:12<KitaFox> Got to the door to the final boss
02:21:21<KitaFox> To open doors, you need map cards.
02:21:28<KitaFox> They come in for varieties.
02:22:33<KitaFox> Red (affects Heartless), Blue (affects the room itself), Green (affects Sora), and Key cards (advances plot)
02:22:40<KitaFox> Well
02:22:50<KitaFox> The doors need specific map cards...
02:23:17<KitaFox> Like... Have a value of 1 or greater, or have a card whose value is 7, or 1 Green card...
02:23:25<KitaFox> Final door?
02:24:01<KitaFox> Asks for a Blue with a 1 value, a Red with a 3 value, an amalgamation of cards whose value is 99 or more, and the Key card.
02:24:16<KitaFox> Have a shit ton of both Blue and Red cards.
02:24:22<KitaFox> No 1 OR 3 value.
02:24:34 KitaFox: has an aneurysm.
02:24:59<KitaFox> Chain of Memories is the most infuriating game Kita has ever played.

23:13:10<KitaFox> Kita freaked out when she beat Marluxia.
23:13:11<KitaFox> Sorry
23:13:47<Laevos> Brother's graduation was happening, sorry, not Zachary though
23:13:52<Laevos> and it's okay!

01:34:36<KitaFox> KITA HAS THEPOWER
01:34:43<KitaFox> THE DARK AURA IS HERS TO COMMAND
01:34:58<KitaFox> Too bad Kita can't CONTROL HER DECK...
01:34:59<KitaFox> DX
01:35:01<Laevos> Woah ;n;
01:35:04<Laevos> Having fun there? xD
01:35:32<KitaFox> Not being able to control the deck is extending the play time, because Kita can't control her Card Power.
01:35:48<KitaFox> And because Kita can't control her card power...
01:35:55<KitaFox> She keep getting card broke.
01:36:46<Laevos> Awwwh ;-;
01:40:52<KitaFox> And getting Card Broke isn't exceptionally bad...
01:40:54<KitaFox> Just annoying.
01:41:03<KitaFox> You get stunned, probably take a little damage...
01:41:20<KitaFox> But you recover pretty fast.
01:41:29<KitaFox> You just get card broke soooo often...
01:41:46<KitaFox> Riku has really reliable Stun+HP gain with Mickey Mouse, though.

22:03:14<KitaFox> At level 13, you can have 6 levels in Master of Shrouds
22:03:30<Laevos> what's that?
22:03:38<KitaFox> Prestige
22:03:48<KitaFox> allows you to summon 4 allips
22:03:56<KitaFox> Which do permanent damage to Wisdom.
22:04:01<KitaFox> Only takes 14 damage.
22:04:23<Laevos> But Tarrasque can only be killed by giving it its HP in nonleathal damage, no?
22:04:37<KitaFox> Nonono.
22:04:44<KitaFox> You put it into a permanent coma.
22:05:10<KitaFox> Allips do Wisdom damage, which it has no damage resistance for.
22:05:17<KitaFox> Once it has no Wisdom
22:05:20<KitaFox> It goes comatose.
22:05:33<KitaFox> Then you can coup-de-grace it, and it can't do shit.
22:06:06<KitaFox> It auto-fails, has -10 health.
22:06:39<KitaFox> If you're hasted, you can then do another coup-de-grace as a half action.
22:07:05<Laevos> Uguu
22:07:09<KitaFox> Do enough damage and continue coup-de-grace-ing, and you can get it low enough in HP to wish it away, and it can't regen the damage.

02:16:10<Laevos> my ex-room mate, the one that I'd gotten in a fight with and everything messaged me on FB and sent me a friend request, the messages saying the following:
02:16:11<Laevos> "Hey, I still owe you an apology for the fall semester.
02:16:11<Laevos> I didn't take the time to think things through and I don't really have any excuse for the way I acted.
02:16:11<Laevos> So it's pretty reasonable if you think I'm a psychopath now or something
02:16:11<Laevos> Since, hell, I probably am
02:16:13<Laevos> But still, sorry for letting my immaturity affect your well-being."
02:17:49<Laevos> and just
02:17:52<Laevos> feelings
02:22:09<KitaFox> All the feelings?
02:22:45<Laevos> Yus x_x
02:22:48<Laevos> WWKD?
02:24:58<KitaFox> Tentatively accept the apology, re-open the relationship after a significant apologetic gesture or a long enough period of time.

12:50:06<KitaFox> o.o
12:51:23 Laevos: licks
12:51:24<Laevos> zzzzzzzz
12:51:32<Laevos> had a very late night
12:52:03<KitaFox> Oh?
12:53:40 Laevos: nodnodnods and points to some purple blotches on her neck @////@
12:54:00 KitaFox: petpats
12:54:10<KitaFox> Had fun?
12:54:24<Laevos> Yessssssss ;-;
12:54:31<Laevos> lots of snuggles
12:54:33<Laevos> and stuff
12:54:44<Laevos> and lots of not-being-alone <3_<3
12:55:18 KitaFox: rub rubs he ears
12:55:28<KitaFox> What was your question?
12:55:36<Laevos> welllll
12:56:19<Laevos> at some point during the night I was told that I make love like a lesbian and I wasn't really sure what that meant @_@ it was a compliment I'm pretty sure
12:56:51 KitaFox: giggles
12:57:08<KitaFox> You're considerate of the other person's needs/
12:57:10<KitaFox> .*
12:57:28<Laevos> :D
13:00:55<Laevos> We were also told that we present in a very 'girl' way, the way we hold our body and talk and stuff
13:01:14<Laevos> and we didn't set off the androphobia of the person that had it xux
13:02:43<KitaFox> androphobia?
13:02:51<Laevos> or something
13:03:01<Laevos> being around men would make her kind of curl up and try to hide, apparently
13:03:07<KitaFox> Oh.
13:03:29<KitaFox> Was there an orgy? :P
13:03:55<Laevos> kinda
13:04:11<Laevos> in one room there was kind of a cuddle orgy for the non-sexual folks
13:04:42<Laevos> and then in the other room we kinda piled up on one person and had super-fun times xux
13:04:50<KitaFox> XP
13:05:58<Laevos> it was apparently really easy to tell that I'm touch-deprived @_@
13:06:14<KitaFox> Awwwwr
13:07:12<Laevos> 'cause I was making really loud sounds and shuddering all throughout my body just from having my back rubbed x/////x
13:08:13 KitaFox: nuzzles
13:08:46 Laevos: clings on and kisses
13:08:52<Laevos> I loooove you;///////;
13:10:09<KitaFox> Love you, too, babe.
13:10:20 KitaFox: kisses her forehead.
13:11:52 Laevos: blushes and hugs tight and kisses back
13:12:02<Laevos> but yeah thanks for letting me babble on like that <3 QuQ

15:13:58<Laevos> How're you, Kita? :3
15:15:24<KitaFox> Just four more Prisms to go, and Kita will have two more achievements in Cookie Clicker.
15:15:36<Laevos> Ooh :3333
15:15:41<KitaFox> When she resets, she'll have broken the 1 Million Heavenly Chip barrier.
15:15:46<KitaFox> So
15:15:49<Laevos> Good job Goddes!
15:15:50<KitaFox> Kita is wiggly.
15:15:55 Laevos: wiggles with
15:16:09<KitaFox> People are worried about a change in the prestige system...
15:16:24<KitaFox> Currently, every HC is a 2% increase in CPS.
15:16:55<KitaFox> And if they become a currency, then people aren't sure if the upgrades purchasable will be worth it.
15:17:25<Laevos> What're Kita's thoughts on the matter? o:
15:17:50<KitaFox> Kita doesn't mind the change, as long as her end CPS is benefitted, or remains the same.
15:18:02<Laevos> Oh okay :3
15:18:22<KitaFox> But the change has yet to be made.
15:18:29<KitaFox> And we still don't have dungeons, yet.
15:18:30<KitaFox> ;.;
15:18:48<Laevos> Cookie dungeons?
15:19:21<KitaFox> Factories, Mines, and Portals will all lead to "Dungeon"-like areas, after a certain upgrade.
15:19:36<KitaFox> (This is in Beta, and can be experienced through beta.)
15:19:46<Laevos> Ooh
15:20:05<KitaFox> BUT
15:23:22<KitaFox> The Beta isn't updated, yet.
15:23:47<KitaFox> So Kita can export her save to it, grab the Shads for the Dungeon stuff, and hop back.
15:25:09<Laevos> Oh  yay :3
15:25:42<KitaFox> Not yay
15:25:44<KitaFox> can't*
15:26:23<Laevos> oh

16:04:22<Laevos> Doing fairly well today! <3 Kind of just resting and recovering today, might not go out because of neck markings, but we'll seeeee
16:05:51<KitaFox> You need some clothes to cover up those "mishaps"
16:05:53<KitaFox> Alright?
16:06:12<KitaFox> Like, a good hooded sweatshirt, and some longer socks.
16:06:22<KitaFox> <3
16:06:44<KitaFox> Kita recommends going a size bigger on the sweatshirt.
16:06:48<KitaFox> Comfy and roomy
16:06:49<KitaFox> <3
16:07:08<Laevos> Yeah @_@
16:07:14<Laevos> it'd be easier if it weren't 90 F out x_x
16:07:39<KitaFox> Roomy sweatshirts are better for hot weather than tight ones
16:07:49<KitaFox> Give you some breathing room.
16:08:13<Laevos> Yeah xwx
16:10:32 KitaFox: rubrubs her cheek.
16:10:47<KitaFox> Better than wearing a douchey scar
16:10:48<KitaFox> f
16:11:36<Laevos> Hehehe
16:11:37<Laevos> true
16:12:18<Laevos> maybe I'll get some foundation

17:00:22<Laevos> Lilith would consider it. Where would she want it placed? <3
17:00:52<KitaFox> Lower left stomach
17:01:18<Laevos> Any particular reason for that placement? And do you know what it would look like? o:
17:01:36<Laevos> Lilith might be willing to make exceptions for something very meaningful like that... <3
17:01:50<KitaFox> Been fine-tuning it for years, is not ready to be placed anywhere.
17:01:57 Laevos: nods
17:02:14<Laevos> Could I see what it's like so far? Or is it not to be revealed until it's ready?
17:02:42<KitaFox> And... Stomach because of Kita's affinity for gluttony, and lower left region because... It just looks better placed on a lower left/right side than anywhere else.
17:02:49<KitaFox> And not until it is ready.
17:03:14<Laevos> Yes Goddess. <3
17:05:00 KitaFox: kisses her cheek,
17:06:04 Laevos: smiles happily and curtsies~

17:30:40<Laevos> Ooh mannnnnnnnn... these voxals are painful :c
17:31:12<KitaFox> Like, to listen to, or to imagine doing?
17:31:26<Laevos> to listen to xD
17:31:44<KitaFox> Imagine how he felt after singing them.
17:31:44<KitaFox> ;.;
17:31:48<KitaFox> His poor throat.
17:32:01<Laevos> Hahaha

17:32:06<KitaFox> Same guy, no vox
17:32:18<Laevos> Maybe I'd feel more empathy for him if he were actually good at harsh vox >:c
17:32:29<KitaFox> XP
17:32:57<KitaFox> Kita was okay with it sounding bad, because she can't imagine DooMguy actually being able to do them, so it fits, contextually?
17:32:57<KitaFox> D:
17:33:19<Laevos> Hahaha xD
17:33:23<Laevos> I suppose it does
17:36:12<KitaFox> I mean
17:36:20<KitaFox> DooMguy IS wearing that shitty mask.
17:36:27<Laevos> Tee-hee xD
17:36:41<KitaFox> Look at the other. No vox.
17:37:28<Laevos> Yes ma'am :3
17:38:52<Laevos> Hehehe
17:39:11 KitaFox: likes video game music, a lot. It is a format that has the ability to exist with or without context, and remixes solidify that aspect of it.

17:46:35<KitaFox> It also allows for the Symphonic Mash-up to be a thing.

17:46:51<Laevos> mash mash mash
17:47:28<KitaFox> So you get some of that techno-ish sound we've come to expect with video games, or rock/metal, which is getting more popular in video games, and powerful symphonic pieces behind them.

19:34:33 KitaFox: noses.
19:34:40<KitaFox> Always use the back of the spoon.
19:34:42<KitaFox> Got it?
19:34:43<KitaFox> :P
19:35:10<Laevos> I never get butter
19:35:16<Laevos> but when I do for other people... I use... a butter knife
19:35:36<Laevos> Not a spoon, people eat off of those, eww! ;o
19:35:52 KitaFox: uses butter for specific pasta dishes, and a spoon for stirring said pasta.
19:35:54<KitaFox> :P

00:52:16<KitaFox> 11 times.
00:52:29<KitaFox> Seriously...
00:52:40<KitaFox> Over the course of the entirety of the Mega Man series...
00:52:45<KitaFox> In both Classic and X...
00:52:55<KitaFox> He is kind of responsible for EVERYTHING.
00:53:07<Laevos> Hahahaha xD
00:53:11<KitaFox> Though, he is only DIRECTLY responsible in like... 11 titles.
00:53:58<KitaFox> He created Zero, and if Zero and Sigma had never met, the Sigma virus would not have ever been a thing.
00:54:17<KitaFox> And all of Mega Man X is because of the Sigma Virus.
00:55:10<KitaFox> And Wily is a bastard.

00:59:32<Laevos> it's not vry good

00:59:48<KitaFox> IS IT
00:59:51<KitaFox> THE NICKELBACK
00:59:53<KitaFox> OF METAL
00:59:56<Laevos> eh no
01:00:09<Laevos> there are some people that are really into it, and it's a legitimate style I guess... but hmm
01:00:49<Laevos> oh yeah
01:00:50<Laevos> Kyuss
01:00:57<KitaFox> o.o
01:01:12<Laevos> most notably on Blues for the Red Sun
01:01:15<Laevos> which I do own
01:01:26<KitaFox> o.o
01:01:38 KitaFox: has no idea what Lilith is talking about.
01:01:40<KitaFox> XD
01:01:48<Laevos> http://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Kyuss/Blues_for_the_Red_Sun/2612
01:01:56<KitaFox> Oh.
01:01:57<KitaFox> Okay.
01:02:11<KitaFox> Kyuss is a band, Blues for the Red Sun is an ablbum.
01:02:13<KitaFox> Got it.
01:02:43<KitaFox> Okay. What would you call the Nickelback of Metal?
01:02:49<Laevos> Hmm...
01:03:05<Laevos> I dunnooooo
01:03:16<Laevos> I generally try to avoid bands with super-shitty reputations
01:03:24<Laevos> I hear Cradle of Filth is pretty bad (and I believe it)
01:03:40<KitaFox> Well
01:04:16<KitaFox> The thing with Nickelback is that they are super popular with people who just listen to music, but they are HATED by people who actually are INTO music.
01:04:51<Laevos> oh right
01:04:53<Laevos> okay so
01:05:01<Laevos> Hmm...
01:08:34<Laevos> well
01:08:45<Laevos> I guess there are a lot of popular bands that are pretty crappy
01:08:49<Laevos> but I don't know
01:08:55<Laevos> trying to think of something Nickelback level
01:08:58<Laevos> and I'm struggling
01:10:27<KitaFox> Slayer
01:10:55<Laevos> Slayer's early work is very highly regarded
01:11:03<Laevos> (I don't think it's anything special, tbh)
01:11:16<Laevos> but yeah, there are a lot of (old) people who think you can't be a metalhead if you don't like
01:11:16 KitaFox: shrugs?
01:11:18<Laevos> SLAAAYYYYYERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
01:11:28<Laevos> and they always type the name like that
01:11:30<Laevos> like how people say it
01:11:37<KitaFox> Isn't Slayer considered like... one of the early thrash bands?
01:11:46<Laevos> they're one of the "big four"
01:11:49<Laevos> and yeah, pretty early
01:12:00<KitaFox> Big four...
01:12:08<KitaFox> Anthrax, Metallica, Slayer, and Megadeth?
01:12:12<Laevos> Yeah, that's correct
01:14:16 KitaFox: was once told that Slayer was not thrash, and that thrash was super technical and calculated.
01:16:29<KitaFox> Kita's experience with thrash is that it is pretty much the opposite.
01:16:43<Laevos> there is technical thrash
01:16:50<Laevos> Slayer is definitely thrash
01:16:55<Laevos> and they're not technical
01:17:00<Laevos> let's see...
01:17:03<KitaFox> They aren't...
01:17:05<Laevos> I know a tech thrash band that people seem to enjoy
01:17:07<KitaFox> They kind of just...
01:17:09<KitaFox> Flail...
01:17:14<Laevos> if you want a link
01:17:19 KitaFox: shrugs?
01:17:23<Laevos> they're pretty modern
01:17:24<KitaFox> Not really into thrash.
01:17:28<Laevos> me neither
01:17:33<Laevos> but if you want to see one actually being technical
01:17:44 KitaFox: shrugs.
01:17:45<KitaFox> Okay.
01:19:03<Laevos> http://earache.bandcamp.com/album/outer-isolation
01:19:13<Laevos> this got some pretty good reviews, I think
01:19:29<Laevos> Lilith isn't a thrash person either, so she has to go off of the judgment of others, hehe

01:35:31 KitaFox: blinks.
01:35:39<KitaFox> This... Why do they still call it thrash?
01:35:51<KitaFox> It has a lot of easily recognisable, repeated patterns.
01:36:14<KitaFox> Oh god... That vocalist.
01:36:24 KitaFox: winces...
01:37:28<Laevos> Hehehe
01:37:34<KitaFox> But yeah.
01:37:52<KitaFox> This is not thrash, in Kita's opinion.
01:37:57<KitaFox> This is very similar to like...
01:38:01<KitaFox> 3 Inches of Blood.
01:38:25<KitaFox> Like... Sure, it is tech-thrash
01:38:32<KitaFox> But this does not sound like thrash.
01:40:52<Laevos> is modern tech thrash
01:42:31<KitaFox> But that is really just a name.
01:42:45<KitaFox> Not to minimalise the importance of categorisation.
01:42:47<KitaFox> Not at all...
01:42:57<KitaFox> But shouldn't the name be more reflective of what it is?
01:43:02<Laevos> that is what it is
01:43:09<Laevos> Kita let's be 4real
01:43:19<Laevos> how many thrash bands have you listened to in the history of ever?
01:43:20 KitaFox: shakes her head and tries to word this better...
01:43:25<Laevos> Kita you're just wrong
01:43:26<Laevos> sorry :c
01:43:52<KitaFox> Kita isn't saying that it ISN'T what its genre is.
01:44:06<KitaFox> Kita is saying that the name of the genre doesn't reflect what it sounds like.
01:44:40<KitaFox> Like... If something is thrashing about... It is kind of uncontrollably flailing itself around in a violent fashion with little rhyme or reason, yes?
01:45:03<Laevos> no
01:45:13<KitaFox> ...O.o
01:45:15<Laevos> not in the music sense of thrash
01:45:26<Laevos> "easily recognizable patterns" are a pretty defining characteristic of thrash
01:45:26<KitaFox> Kita isn't talking about the music sense.
01:45:27<Laevos> i.e., riffs
01:45:34<Laevos> it's the name of the genre
01:45:39<Laevos> death metal doesn't sound like people dying
01:45:41<KitaFox> Kita is talking about the word.
01:45:46<Laevos> why...?
01:45:49<Laevos> just for the sake of arguing?
01:45:50<Laevos> Come on
01:45:50<Laevos> please
01:45:53<Laevos> just don't.
01:46:02<Laevos> you thrash around when you listen to thrash
01:46:03<Laevos> like
01:46:04<Laevos> in a mosh pit
01:46:09<Laevos> hence the term
01:46:12<Laevos> a lot of genre names are dumb
01:46:15<KitaFox> Okay, see... That is what Kita was going for.
01:46:25<KitaFox> Kita was wanting a reason for the name to be like it is.
01:46:26<Laevos> or aren't really related to the names of the terms in their literal meaning
01:46:31<Laevos> okay
01:46:35<Laevos> well that's pretty much it
01:46:36<Laevos> like
01:46:41<Laevos> thrash is pretty simplistic
01:46:43<KitaFox> that makes more sense, though.
01:46:56<Laevos> tries to have catchy, straightforward riffs that are easy to headbang to, a lot of the time
01:47:03<Laevos> so you can thrash around to it pretty easily
01:47:07<Laevos> not that it's spastic or off-the-wall
01:47:11<Laevos> does that make more sense, love?
01:48:01<KitaFox> Yes.
01:48:16<Laevos> Okay, good ;////////;
01:48:20 Laevos: smoochles
01:48:20<KitaFox> Like... Death Metal made sense. Early Death Metal was pretty focused on DEATH as a theme in the music.
01:49:01<KitaFox> You know... Like that Scandanavian guy who shot himself in the head, and his bandmates used his dead body as an album cover, and they were a very early "death metal" band.
01:49:13<Laevos> they were a black metal band :P
01:49:15<Laevos> that was Mayhem
01:49:24<KitaFox> Okay.
01:49:25<KitaFox> Well.
01:49:31<Laevos> and the picture was used in a bootleg,  not an official release
01:49:35<KitaFox> Ah.
01:49:35<Laevos> "Dawn of the Black Hearts"
01:49:40<Laevos> a band member /did/ take the picture, though
01:49:44<Laevos> and that's a pretty famous bootleg
01:49:44<KitaFox> Yes.
01:49:46<KitaFox> So
01:49:46<Laevos> historical and shit
01:49:55<KitaFox> Kita got part of it right, from memory.
01:50:01 Laevos: nods :3
01:50:18<KitaFox> And while death metal and black metal are not the same, they are similar enough for Kita to confuse them.
01:50:39<KitaFox> (And Kita really doesn't listen to either death or black.)
01:51:49<Laevos> Yeah, things can be difficult to distinguish when you don't listen to them, I get that sometimes with other things
01:52:04<Laevos> electronic music genres are by and large a mystery to me
01:52:07<Laevos> HOUSE DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A HOUSE
01:52:09<Laevos> COME ON
01:52:30<Laevos> (as far as I know
01:52:31<Laevos> )
01:52:44<KitaFox> :P
01:53:13<KitaFox> House is actually a reference to style that is quick, and easy to produce on the fly, because it is made "in-house" and live.
01:53:17<KitaFox> As Kita understands it.
01:53:22<Laevos> Huh, okay
01:53:32<KitaFox> So yeah.
01:53:37<KitaFox> House makes sense!
01:53:40<Laevos> Yay :D
01:53:52<Laevos> So acid house is when you make something in your house
01:53:52<Laevos> and
01:53:55<Laevos> you're on acid
01:54:09<KitaFox> In-house refers to being in a club, or rave.
01:54:14<KitaFox> And producing new content live.
01:54:25<Laevos> yeah
01:54:26<Laevos> :3
01:54:47<KitaFox> And Acid house refers to a more rave-centric style.
01:55:02<KitaFox> Raves commonly have acid being passed around.
01:55:58<KitaFox> And French House is a style created and popularised by Daft Punk... Who are French, and started with House, and moved onto a more complicated style with recorded lyrics and a complete lack of pre-recorded audio samples.
01:56:23<Laevos> how French
01:57:14<KitaFox> Daft Punk?
01:57:27<KitaFox> Eh... Kinda French.
01:57:43<KitaFox> They were French citizens for a while, if Kita remembers right.
01:58:05<Laevos> oh, that wasn't a question xD
01:58:08<Laevos> more like
01:58:14<Laevos> Oh, how very French (of them)
01:58:24<KitaFox> Oh.
01:58:28<Laevos> To be honest
01:58:30<Laevos> it didn't make any sense
01:58:37<Laevos> there doesn't seem to be anything inherently French about any of that :D
01:58:48<Laevos> But it's 2:00AM and Lilith is kinda tired
01:58:51<Laevos> making herself some noodles
01:59:10<KitaFox> o.o
01:59:33<Laevos> and earlier was listening to a thing that Lilith isn't allowed to show kita
01:59:39<Laevos> because Kita specifically said no more noisesounds
02:01:02<KitaFox> Good girl for remembering.
02:01:39<KitaFox> Honestly, noise sounds just grate on Kita because true chaos is the most terrifying thing... And that stuff is just... a musical incarnation of chaos.
02:01:45<KitaFox> and just no.
02:01:49<KitaFox> Never going back there.
02:01:50<KitaFox> Never.
02:02:18<Laevos> Never ever <3
02:02:34<Laevos> Lilith will be a good girl and not forget that <3
02:04:06<Laevos> Lilith does like this tape design, though, very clean, two-color layout xux http://www.discogs.com/viewimages?release=590172
02:04:09<Laevos> (no sounds, just images)
02:04:31<Laevos> (and nothing scary unless Kita is scared of jellyfish)
02:06:00<KitaFox> Jellyfish are adourable.
02:06:00<KitaFox> :<
02:06:12<Laevos> I like them :3333
02:06:20<Laevos> Have you ever seen the anime "Princess Jellyfish"?
02:06:31<KitaFox> Nope.
02:06:44<Laevos> Lilith likes it
02:06:45<Laevos> it's cute
02:06:46<Laevos> and
02:06:47<Laevos> jellyfish
02:06:54<KitaFox> Kita has a very specific criteria for anime... And some people find it annoying.
02:07:06<KitaFox> 1) No Harem
02:07:06<Laevos> They're not in high school (!!!!!!)
02:07:14<KitaFox> 2) No Schools of any kind
02:07:15<Laevos> CHeck
02:07:16<Laevos> Check
02:07:27<Laevos> well
02:07:29<Laevos> let me amend that
02:07:35<KitaFox> 3) Characters must be adults, in their society.
02:07:40<Laevos> there's a scene where a character is shown walking to school, but then skips
02:07:58<Laevos> check, they're mostly 30somethings, youngest around 20something
02:08:18<Laevos> Maybe one 18-year-old
02:08:20<KitaFox> Kita DOES make exceptions to rules number 2 and 3...
02:08:39<KitaFox> Number 2 is when the plot is not centered around the school, and most of the action takes place outside
02:08:59<Laevos> It does
02:09:10<KitaFox> 3 can be overruled by a complete absence of fanservice or feature exaggeration in the underaged.
02:09:45<Laevos> Lilith thinks that Princess Jellyfish is great
02:09:46<Laevos> hmm
02:10:04<KitaFox> 4) Good subs, or good dubs. If there are good dubs, then the dubs are preferred.
02:10:14<Laevos> The dub is great
02:10:19<KitaFox> Kita will not do an anime that doesn't have one or the other.
02:10:33<Laevos> Funimation's gotten a lot better in recent years
02:10:43<KitaFox> If an anime is only available in Japanese, and the subtitles are terrible, then shunned. Even if the show is good.
02:10:49<KitaFox> Kita HAS to be able to understand it.
02:10:54<Laevos> ya
02:10:57<Laevos> pretty importanT
02:11:10<KitaFox> And the last one...
02:11:42<KitaFox> There has to be at least two female characters of moderate plot importance that talk about something that isn't a man in at least one episode.
02:11:53<Laevos> That's the whole show
02:11:54<Laevos> :3
02:12:10<Laevos> It passes the
02:12:12<Laevos> whatever it's called
02:12:12<Laevos> test
02:12:13<KitaFox> It will be considered.
02:12:21 KitaFox: adds it to the list.
02:12:41<Laevos> :3
02:13:10<Laevos> Most of the characters are female, and it isn't a harem
02:13:51 KitaFox: despises Harems.
02:13:58 KitaFox: despises high-school type drama.
02:14:13<Laevos> that's fair
02:14:18<Laevos> I /did/ like Tenchi Muyo
02:14:21<Laevos> I still do
02:14:26<Laevos> and it's pretty harem-y
02:14:41<Laevos> but other things happen too I guess
02:14:48<Laevos> still, not one I'd recommend to Kita if she hasn't seen it
02:14:54<Laevos> just because it doesn't seem like something she'd like
02:15:10<KitaFox> Look...
02:15:21 Laevos: looks
02:15:34<KitaFox> See the three things Kita says cannot be excepted?
02:15:39<KitaFox> 1, 4, and 5.
02:15:49<Laevos> yeah
02:15:51<Laevos> that's okay :3
02:15:56<KitaFox> The big four GAINAX anime...
02:16:20<KitaFox> Neon Genesis: Evangelion, FLCL, Tengan Toppa Gurren Lagann, and Kill La Kill all pass those.
02:16:36<Laevos> Hmm
02:16:42<Laevos> which female characters talked in FLCL?
02:16:48<Laevos> to each other, I mean
02:17:53<KitaFox> Main chick, chick that followed Lord Canti
02:17:59<KitaFox> Er...
02:18:03<KitaFox> yeah.
02:18:19<Laevos> Mamimi
02:18:33<KitaFox> The younger girl.
02:18:34<KitaFox> Yeah.
02:18:42<Laevos> you mean the OLDER one
02:18:50<KitaFox> Well... Her.
02:18:50<KitaFox> Yes.
02:18:54<KitaFox> And the younger girl.
02:19:02<Laevos> with the fake glasses?
02:19:05<Laevos> Naota's classmate?
02:19:11<Laevos> Oh yeahhhhh
02:19:13<Laevos> they do
02:19:20 KitaFox: nods.
02:19:26<KitaFox> Doesn't need to be very long...
02:19:30<Laevos> Hehe, fair enough
02:19:36<KitaFox> and it doesn't even need to be an important conversation.
02:19:40<KitaFox> Just needs to happen.
02:19:40<Laevos> Maybe Excel Saga would pass, too >u>
02:19:54<KitaFox> Keep in mind...
02:20:01<KitaFox> Sometimes bad Anime passes...
02:20:04<Laevos> Yeah
02:20:04<Laevos> :P
02:20:09<Laevos> But Excel Saga is great!
02:20:44<KitaFox> Eureka 7, Ghost in the Shell (Don't care what everyone else says... GitS is not good. It is just a retelling of a technophobic, negative utopian novel), and Code Geass all pass.
02:21:36<Laevos> Ghost in the Shell as in the series or the movie?
02:21:53<Laevos> The first GitS movie is one of my favorite thingies
02:22:11<Laevos> the '90s one
02:22:17<Laevos> and yeah Eureka 7 was total shit
02:22:21<Laevos> 0/any number
02:24:59<KitaFox> The... series.
02:25:07<Laevos> Okay
02:25:15<Laevos> I think the series was inferior to the movie in most respects
02:25:22<Laevos> but I still found it entertaining
02:25:24<Laevos> it's okay though
02:27:25<KitaFox> That series is REALLY technophobic.
02:27:36<KitaFox> And Kita is not okay with technophobia.
02:28:42<Laevos> Yeah, a lot of that cyberpunk-type stuff didn't really have a very clear idea on actual technology

02:43:24 KitaFox: wiggles.
02:44:39 Laevos: lickies
02:44:50<KitaFox> Got Pokemon Y, yet?
02:45:01<Laevos> Not yet, sorry love :c
02:45:12<KitaFox> Do you know the three starters, at least?
02:45:17<Laevos> ya
02:45:28<Laevos> I'd ask about it, but I don't wanna be like
02:45:37<Laevos> WHY HAVEN'T YOU GIVEN ME A GAME FOR FREE YET??????????????
02:46:20<KitaFox> X3
02:47:11 KitaFox: contemplates a proper and polite wording.
02:47:41<KitaFox> Did they propose a time or place where they would give it to you
02:47:45<KitaFox> "
02:47:46<KitaFox> ?*
02:49:28<Laevos> Nah
02:49:37<Laevos> just after they'd backed up their Pokemon in that box thing
02:54:07<KitaFox> You should send them a text with a casual "Yo, lemme know when I can come grab that game" or "Hey, when is a good time we could meet up so I could take that game off your hands?"
02:54:18<Laevos> Yeah, something like that
02:54:18<Laevos> ;w;
02:54:20<Laevos> Uguu~
02:54:24<KitaFox> Try to word it as closely to a drug deal as you can.
02:54:34<Laevos> Teehee
02:54:50<KitaFox> Pokemon X-tacy
02:54:56<Laevos> Hey, uh... I hear you're the guy to talk to about getting ahold of some... game?
02:55:00<KitaFox> C? s*
02:55:07<Laevos> *shifty looks*
02:55:20<Laevos> dang ragequitters
02:55:47<KitaFox> Kita totally doesn't play in the Summer.
02:55:48<KitaFox> :P
02:56:29<Laevos> Yeah
02:56:31<Laevos> good idea
02:56:32<Laevos> :cccc
02:56:40 KitaFox: is also trying to metapredict the meta game for when AS and OR come out.
02:56:41<KitaFox> :<
02:56:59<Laevos> Hehehe xD
02:57:18<KitaFox> Kita has yet to ever be successful.
02:57:31<Laevos> Awwh
02:57:35<KitaFox> "Man... Mega Ampharos is going to see a lot of use"
02:57:43<KitaFox> Mega Ampharos is completely unused.
02:58:36<KitaFox> "Delphox's potential as a special sweeper is going to get it some definite usage... Psychic needs more Fire-coverage, and Fire needs more Psychic-coverage, desperately."
02:58:53<KitaFox> Greninja is the only starter they use.
02:59:20<KitaFox> "No one is going to use Mega Mawile, because Mega Charizard Y is such a huge threat."
02:59:25<KitaFox> Pfff,,
02:59:34<KitaFox> It is like... the third most-used Mega.
03:00:16<Laevos> xD
03:00:19<KitaFox> "Steel-type is going to be defensively threatened by the nerf.."
03:00:22<KitaFox> Bronzong.
03:00:26<KitaFox> Just... Bronzong.
03:01:00<Laevos> too much Bronzong
03:01:10<Laevos> omg
03:01:21<Laevos> please let me sweep this guy's last four Pokemon with a Pelipper
03:01:27<KitaFox> XD
03:01:34<KitaFox> Go forth and do so
03:01:46<Laevos> YOU CAN DO IT
03:01:48<Laevos> YOU HAVE TAILWIND
03:01:49<Laevos> AND SHIT
03:02:27<Laevos> OH NO NOT ANYMORE
03:02:37<KitaFox> o.o
03:02:48<Laevos> Oh well
03:02:51<Laevos> the end xD

03:26:51<Laevos> "3
03:26:52<Laevos> :3
03:26:53<Laevos> I love you
03:27:23<KitaFox> Love you too, babe.
03:27:28 KitaFox: rubrubs behind her ear.
03:28:10 Laevos: purrs lovingly <3333
03:28:34 KitaFox: is totally air-drumming to industrial techno, IRL.
03:28:56<KitaFox> Complicated, deep, bass-y drumbeats are Kita's groove.
03:29:46<Laevos> Nice :3
03:31:03<KitaFox> Nine Inch Nails... Is REALLY hit and miss with Kita. There are some pieces Kita loves, and pieces she HAAAAATES.
03:31:16<Laevos> Hehehe
03:31:36<KitaFox> The Perfect Drug, You Know What You Are?, and With Teeth... Are pieces Kita likes...
03:32:16<KitaFox> Complicated drum rhythms with either harsh, short sounds (like hitting the rims of drums, not like cymbal crashs), or deep bass-y tones...
03:32:35<Laevos> I played The Perfect Drug on Rock Band
03:32:38<Laevos> I KNOW HOW IT GOES
03:32:41<KitaFox> Over very simple, distorted techno melodies
03:32:50<KitaFox> The Perfect Drug is fucking hard on drums.
03:33:07<Laevos> :3
03:33:09<Laevos> so fun
03:33:10<Laevos> tho
03:33:20<KitaFox> It has to be one of their most complex pieces.
03:33:24<KitaFox> Is fun to play.
03:33:40<KitaFox> Shitty songs can be SO MUCH FUN to play on a Rock Band drumkit...
03:33:59<Laevos> Hehehe
03:34:04<KitaFox> Like Tom Sawyer by Rush.
03:34:08<KitaFox> Kita doesn't like Rush.
03:34:16<KitaFox> Playing that shit on Drums is fucking fun.
03:34:28<KitaFox> Ballroom Blitz by Sweet...
03:34:39<KitaFox> Also not a Kita-approved song.
03:34:44<KitaFox> FUCKING FUN ON DRUMS.
03:35:02<KitaFox> Kita has an appreciation for percussion and bass.
03:35:18<Laevos> :3
03:35:25<KitaFox> Probably moreso than a lot of people...
03:35:34<KitaFox> But like...
03:35:38<Laevos> you better be playing on xxxpert
03:35:40<KitaFox> Good foundations = Good music.
03:35:49<KitaFox> Kita actually plays on Rock Band 3's Pro.
03:35:53<KitaFox> :P
03:36:00<Laevos> Yeah, that
03:36:02<Laevos> since
03:36:07<Laevos> I never played RB3333
03:36:12<Laevos> much
03:36:13<Laevos> at all
03:36:19<KitaFox> Okay...
03:36:32<KitaFox> Pro mode turns the game into a tutorial on playing the instruments.
03:36:34<Laevos> Yeah
03:36:36<Laevos> I've seen it
03:36:40<KitaFox> Much less game, until you can play the instruments.
03:38:38<Laevos> nodnod
03:40:02<KitaFox> But so worth it.
03:40:55<Laevos> :3
03:41:42<KitaFox> Drums doesn't change TOO much, honestly.
03:42:26<Laevos> Yeah
03:42:27<Laevos> they're drums
03:42:28<Laevos> it's what you do
03:42:31<Laevos> to drums
03:42:46<Laevos> except for songs with lots of double bass
03:42:51<KitaFox> Cymbal pads become necessary.
03:42:54<Laevos> gotta get those feet moving
03:43:09<Laevos> & have two kick pedals
03:43:16<KitaFox> Well...
03:43:28<KitaFox> You can... one kick-pedal it...
03:43:35<Laevos> pff
03:43:45<Laevos> not the ones that really need you to have two kick pedals
03:43:46<Laevos> like
03:43:47<Laevos> the pro ones
03:43:48<KitaFox> But you have to be... really fucking fast at it.
03:43:55<Laevos> it's physically not happening on some of them
03:44:02<KitaFox> Yeah...
03:44:35<KitaFox> Nightmare, by Crooked X, has a moment where the drummer is OBVIOUSLY using 2 kickpedals...
03:44:40<KitaFox> But you can do it with 1.
03:44:45<KitaFox> Kita can, anyway.
03:45:23<Laevos> yeah
03:45:25<Laevos> sometimes you can
03:49:03<KitaFox> Also, at the time of Rock Band's original release..
03:49:15<KitaFox> All of Crooked X's band members were underage.
03:49:19<KitaFox> They couldn't even vote.
03:49:39<KitaFox> One could drink in Germany.
03:50:34<KitaFox> Also, if you're playing with friends, and you're in a band...
03:50:48<KitaFox> You never, ever, pick Green Grass and High Tides.
03:51:30<KitaFox> Funny thing...
03:51:43<Laevos> >uuuuuuuu>
03:51:43<KitaFox> Kita has the lyrics memorised for GGaHT.
03:51:55<Laevos> I've picked that before
03:51:56<Laevos> hehehehe
03:52:10<KitaFox> She could never subject her friends to it, to earn the special instruments...
03:52:18<Laevos> 3:
03:52:33<KitaFox> So she just memorised the song, did the guitar part, and sang the lyrics into the mic.
03:52:36<KitaFox> Like a boss.
03:52:40<KitaFox> Gold Stars.
03:53:16<Laevos> Hehehehehe
03:53:17<Laevos> yay :3
03:53:29<KitaFox> To this day, the only songs Kita has yet to gold star...
03:53:44<KitaFox> I'm So Sick, by Flyleaf, with vocals only...
03:54:01<KitaFox> And Won't Get Fooled Again, by The Who, on Drums.
03:55:23 KitaFox: had her bro sing I'm So Sick, for her, because Kita can five star it, but he has enough low-range to gold star it without voice strain.
03:55:25<KitaFox> ;.;
03:55:46<KitaFox> And she is just... so high pitched.
03:56:23<KitaFox> Also
03:56:26<KitaFox> TIMMEH
03:56:37<KitaFox> And the Lords of the Underworld~!
03:56:41<Laevos> TIMMEH
03:56:52<KitaFox> Darkness fills my heart with pain~
03:56:59<Laevos> I wish the Rockband kit I had could do blasts properly
03:57:09<KitaFox> As in... Blast beats?
03:57:13<Laevos> it seemed to fuck up the sensors @_@
03:57:14<Laevos> yeah
03:57:17<KitaFox> heh
03:57:23<Laevos> then again, I just had the standard kit
03:57:24<KitaFox> Kita has custom kick pedals.
03:57:27<Laevos> yeah
03:57:29<Laevos> probz necessary
03:57:44<KitaFox> Pretttttty much.
03:58:07<Laevos> :nnnnnnnnnnn;
04:00:29 KitaFox: begins lickgrooming Lilith's hair, giving her a foxlick
04:01:35<KitaFox> Kita's first time gold starring Timmy & The Lords of the Underworld...
04:02:05<KitaFox> She was so happy, she smashed the controller on the ground, in a frustrated triumph.
04:02:31 Laevos: purrs and listens
04:02:34<Laevos> Awwh xD
04:02:36<Laevos> Did it break? ;n;
04:02:37<KitaFox> For whatever reason, the main verse riff would just kick her ass.
04:02:39<KitaFox> It did.
04:02:44<Laevos> oh well
04:02:45<Laevos> worth it
04:02:49<KitaFox> Snapped the neck right in half.
04:03:05<KitaFox> Bro had walked in for the last 30 seconds...
04:03:23<KitaFox> And that is a song where you just BARELY gold star it, so you're on the edge of your seat the entire time.
04:03:35 Laevos: nods in agreement
04:03:57<KitaFox> NOW WHOSE HEART IS FILLED WITH PAIN YOU EMO FUCKFACES
04:04:00<KitaFox> *SMASH*
04:04:02<KitaFox> Oh shit
04:04:29<KitaFox> And Kita knows why the main verse riff was hard for her...
04:04:39<KitaFox> Each piece had two speeds...
04:04:47<KitaFox> Going up was slower than going down.
04:05:17<Laevos> !!
04:05:20<KitaFox> Going up was on eigths, going down was on sixteenths, or something like that.
04:05:25<Laevos> Oh
04:05:27<Laevos> interassting
04:05:30<KitaFox> Remember it?
04:05:31<Laevos> yeah
04:05:32<Laevos> I do
04:05:39<Laevos> it always seemed kind of
04:05:40<Laevos> off
04:06:15<KitaFox> Yeah.
04:06:24<KitaFox> It bothered Kita. She wanted to do it at one speed.
04:06:31<KitaFox> It felt like it should be one speed.
04:06:41<KitaFox> But it wasn't.
04:06:53<Laevos> Yeah :c
04:06:57<Laevos> It was just SPITEFUL
04:07:04<KitaFox> Exactly.
04:07:11<KitaFox> Whoever wrote it...
04:07:19<KitaFox> Darkness had filled their heart with pain.
04:07:20<KitaFox> :
04:07:23<KitaFox> :<*
04:07:53<KitaFox> Or they were just retarded.
04:08:00<KitaFox> Hey! Two references!
04:08:01<KitaFox> :D

04:08:14 KitaFox: snickers.
04:08:18 Laevos: licks :3
04:08:24<KitaFox> Kita actually likes South Park.
04:08:25<KitaFox> :P
04:08:48<Laevos> I've only seen a few episodes
04:08:53<KitaFox> It is hilarious, up-to-date social commentary.
04:09:38<KitaFox> They can crank out an episode whose plot is entirely based upon something that happened the week between two episodes.
04:09:59<KitaFox> So very often, it is very relevant to the time.
04:10:42<KitaFox> Obama's 13, which is a parody of Ocean's 13, and a commentary on political scandel and how ridiculous conspiracy theories can be...
04:10:59<KitaFox> Used actual soundbytes from Obama's inauguration.
04:11:02<KitaFox> So yeah.
04:11:20<KitaFox> Oh, and this episode aired something like... 3 days after that speech.
04:11:37<KitaFox> They are INSANELY relevant, all the time.
04:13:12 KitaFox: rubs kittymuzzle
04:13:19 Laevos: licks
04:13:20<Laevos> well
04:13:23<Laevos> I live under a rock
04:13:28<Laevos> so I probably wouldn't get it >u>
04:13:37<KitaFox> You live in an apartment, silly.
04:15:48<Laevos> yeah
04:15:52<Laevos> but there's a rock on the roof
04:20:38<Laevos> ;33333
04:20:45<KitaFox> :P
04:21:28<Laevos> Kitaaaa
04:21:40<KitaFox> ?
04:21:43<Laevos> when I'm over there can I curl up with you in bed and we can fall asleep together? Q_Q
04:22:03<KitaFox> If there is room.
04:22:13<KitaFox> Remember, Kita kind of sleeps in a closet room.
04:22:17<KitaFox> A small space.
04:22:29<KitaFox> But lives and does stuff outside of this space.
04:22:36<KitaFox> The closet is a protection thing.
04:22:38<KitaFox> Like a den.
04:23:11<KitaFox> Foxes have a larger communal space, and then smaller, spaced out divots in the den, where they sleep when it is warm.
04:23:15<KitaFox> When it is cold, they bundle.
04:24:16<KitaFox> Kita's fox wants to snuggle when it is cold.
04:24:28<Laevos> Oh okay
04:24:29<KitaFox> Kita's fox wants to be independant when it is warm.
04:24:32<Laevos> :3
04:24:41<KitaFox> Kita mimics this behaviour.
04:24:45<KitaFox> Finds it comfortable.
04:29:19 KitaFox: offers some chocolate candies.
04:29:31 Laevos: nuzzles them
04:29:41 Laevos: takes them on a romantic date

04:30:29<KitaFox> Not a fan of chocolate?

00:37:02<Laevos> I fell asleep

00:37:07<KitaFox> o.o
00:37:10<KitaFox> O.o
00:37:13<Laevos> 16:00
00:37:14<Laevos> or so
00:37:16<Laevos> and woke up at

00:41:06 Laevos: licks ;w

00:45:40<KitaFox> Okay
00:45:45<KitaFox> So Kita is playing TWEWY
00:45:49<KitaFox> And the Progfox...
00:45:57<KitaFox> It is easily the strongest enemy in the game.
00:46:00<Laevos> o:
00:46:09<KitaFox> Even the final boss can't do 200+ damage in one hit...
00:46:18<KitaFox> Progfox can. And you can't dodge it.
00:46:37<Laevos> o_o
00:47:16 KitaFox: beat the Progfox, but did super poorly, and did not do it at level 1.

01:20:20<KitaFox> The World Ends With You
01:20:27<KitaFox> Is a DS game
01:20:27<Laevos> Oh, okay o:
01:21:06<KitaFox> One of the most unique RPGs Kita has ever played
01:21:14<Laevos> :3
01:21:16<KitaFox> and it has a modern setting
01:21:54<KitaFox> Pretty hard to learn, though
01:22:10<Laevos> aww
01:22:25<KitaFox> Like...
01:22:35<KitaFox> There is a lot of content...

04:26:54<KitaFox> Grindcore Minks are pussies.
04:26:59<KitaFox> Took them out at level 1.
04:27:10<KitaFox> ANd they can't even hit Joshua while he is in the air.
04:27:13<KitaFox> This is silly.
04:27:16<Laevos> lol what
04:27:40<KitaFox> Okay
04:27:54<KitaFox> So all the enemies in the game are referred to as "Noise"
04:28:10<KitaFox> And are all named after some musical pun or reference.
04:28:26<Laevos> Uh-huh
04:28:41<KitaFox> And they are all themed after certain parts...
04:29:03<KitaFox> Like the Mosh Grizzly, and his older, much stronger brother... The Circle Pit Grizzly.
04:29:16<KitaFox> Or the Garage Wolf and Alterna Wolf.
04:29:23<KitaFox> J Popguin
04:29:25<Laevos> Oh okay
04:29:31<KitaFox> Thrash Mink
04:29:52<KitaFox> And the optional boss version of the minks are called Grindcore Minks.
04:30:00<KitaFox> You fight two at the same time.
04:30:00<Laevos> Hehehe
04:30:19<KitaFox> There are also "Taboo" Noise... Which only live in Black Noise symbols.
04:30:49<KitaFox> They are often greyed out colour schemes, and their tribal-tattoo looking bits are often bigger and more intricate.
04:31:38<KitaFox> So like... The Grizzlies don't have arms. They have moving tribal tattoos... in the shape of arms.
04:31:43 KitaFox: likes the design.
04:31:50<KitaFox> And all the enemies have something like.
04:32:01<KitaFox> The Frogs have tattoo back legs...
04:32:09<KitaFox> The Wolves have tattoo forelegs.
04:32:30<KitaFox> The hardest enemy in the game, though?
04:32:35<KitaFox> The Progfox.
04:32:41<Laevos> Pflflflflf ;w;
04:32:59<KitaFox> So, the Progfox teleports before combo finishers.
04:33:16<KitaFox> So it'll take every hit, except for the exceptionally more powerful finisher move.
04:33:19<KitaFox> And then poof.
04:34:01<Laevos> QnQ
04:34:03<KitaFox> So using stuff like Pyro or Telekinesis is preferred... because they don't combo or have a finisher.
04:34:21<KitaFox> And do slightly more damage than Shockwave or Force Rounds, which do combo.
04:34:21<KitaFox> :P
04:34:53<KitaFox> It also has a habit of charging an attack that will one hit kill you at lowest levels.
04:35:34<Laevos> Oh no ;n;
04:35:38<KitaFox> Yeah.
04:35:45<KitaFox> Progfox is awesome.
04:36:14<KitaFox> It also has the red/white motif generally used in the portrayal of benevolent, Shintoist gods...
04:36:47<KitaFox> Like their God of the Sun, Okami Amaterasu, or their God of the Grain, Okami Inari.
04:37:37<KitaFox> Inari is a lesser God, and while her proper title is "Okami Inari" she is supposedly not offended by the dropping of the Okami title, viewing it as an unneccessary formality. Everyone knows she is a God, already.
04:37:38<KitaFox> :P
04:38:04<Laevos> Mmmm ;u;

16:10:28<KitaFox> [14:02] <Kita> Doesn't mean they can't give it a shot.
16:10:28<KitaFox> [14:02] <Kita> If they suck, at least they had the balls/ovaries/whatever to try.
16:10:34 Laevos: nods
16:10:58<KitaFox> And while you can criticise their performance, you should not criticise their tenacity.
16:13:41<Laevos> Yeah it's all good bbly
16:13:48 KitaFox: licks.
16:13:48<Laevos> 999
16:13:49<Laevos> zzz
16:13:51 Laevos: cuddles
16:14:44<KitaFox> Some people think the band Ghost is metal. Others, Progrock. Kita says Occult rock. Their music is really, really simple... Like... 4/4 time signature simple.
16:15:18<KitaFox> And Prog anything is known for having an amount of complexity quite a bit beyond Ghost.
16:15:19<Laevos> Yeah, Ghost are definitely not prog
16:15:24<Laevos> Ghoast
16:15:27<Laevos> Goats
16:15:43 KitaFox: doesn't understand Goat Simulator.
16:15:51<Laevos> err, there should be "Goast" between the last two
16:16:06<Laevos> thus, Ghost are only three degrees away from metal
16:16:08<Laevos> and
16:16:14<Laevos> Goat Simulator is a game for people who like glitches I guess
16:16:17<Laevos> and things randomly breaking
16:16:26<Laevos> it seems like a neat little toy I guess
16:16:27<Laevos> I dunno
16:16:34<Laevos> I mean I like glitches
16:16:38<KitaFox> Yeah... It is more "toyish" than "gameish"
16:16:45<Laevos> Yeah, definitely
16:16:47<Laevos> I mean
16:16:50<Laevos> I haven't played it
16:16:54<Laevos> but that's /definitely/ how it seems xD
16:17:08 KitaFox: thinks games need to begin defining that line.
16:17:19<KitaFox> What is a game, and what is a software toy.
16:17:52<KitaFox> Games have goals, structure, iconography, involvement.
16:18:11<KitaFox> In this sense...
16:18:18<KitaFox> Mario is a game, Tetris is a toy.
16:18:43<Laevos> I see what you mean
16:20:26<KitaFox> And Tetris is a great way to pass time.
16:20:44<KitaFox> Don't get Kita wrong here... Nothing wrong with playing with a toy.
16:21:01 KitaFox: has logged quite a bit of time in various Tetris games.
16:21:23<KitaFox> But Kita does not feel much attachment or involvement with it...
16:21:35<Laevos> sure
16:21:43<KitaFox> It kind of has a goal (get the most points you can get!) and it certainly has structure...
16:21:48<KitaFox> But it really lacks DEPTH.
16:22:00<Laevos> not deep enof 0/game
16:22:08<Laevos> But yeah
16:22:36<KitaFox> Compare modern Tetris releases (Tetris Worlds) to like... Modern JRPGs.
16:22:46<KitaFox> Totally different ideas behind them.
16:22:50<KitaFox> Completely.
16:23:00<KitaFox> And I think the community should begin reflecting on this.
16:23:17<KitaFox> Goat Simulator is not equal to The World Ends With You.
16:23:44<KitaFox> Surgeon Simulator is not equal to Mario Kart 8.
16:24:02<KitaFox> Tetris isn't equal to Mario.
16:24:43<KitaFox> All six things mentioned are highly revered and very much praised by a majority of the gaming community.
16:24:59<KitaFox> (At least, the community that calls itself the gaming community)
16:25:47<KitaFox> And while games are not entirely objective... there is a little bit of objectiveness in discussing them.
16:26:19<KitaFox> The quality of the voice-acting... The general engagement of the player character... The ability to create an environment and setting...
16:26:45<KitaFox> Everyone can look at Shadow the Hedgehog and go "Yeah. That was some shitty voice-acting."
16:27:29<KitaFox> But it becomes harder when you look at The Last of Us and Dragon Age: Origins, to tell which game did voices better...
16:27:33<KitaFox> But both of them did it GOOD.
16:27:46<KitaFox> And Kita means good, not well.
16:28:04<KitaFox> They generally improved the opinion of voice acting in games.
16:28:29<KitaFox> (They did that by doing it well, though.)
16:32:42<Laevos> Dunno those games o:
16:32:42<Laevos> but
16:32:47<Laevos> I'm about to head out from the Library

21:51:14<Laevos> :3
21:51:51<KitaFox> Like...
21:52:42<KitaFox> Kita is polyamourous, and thinks that monogamy is a socil construct created by more intelligent, weaker males to ensure they could ensure mates, in the past...
21:54:08<KitaFox> (Considering that the ranks of the churches of the world are dominated by men... and that the "meek inheriting the Earth" idea is very prevalent in all of them... That the prosecuted are the ones protected by God...)

18:08:06<KitaFox> Stephen Hawking has actually been a brain dead vegetable for years, ever since he lost his ability to speak. In reality, a team of discredited scientists use him as a mouthpiece for hypotheses that are too controversial to be presented by less renowned scientists. - /u/JustinianTheWrong

15:05:57<Laevos> Woop woop o:
15:05:59<Laevos> Is it great?
15:06:40<KitaFox> It is pretty much Mega Man X in 2.5D.
15:06:45<Laevos> Ooh
15:07:39<KitaFox> But yeah
15:07:47<KitaFox> Mega Man X is the shit.
15:07:50<Laevos> Yay :D
15:08:08<KitaFox> Also, you get to play as Vile.
15:08:11<Laevos> Oooo
15:08:14<KitaFox> In New Game +
15:08:18<KitaFox> But only as Vile.
15:08:18<Laevos> Do you get to play as Dr. Wily?
15:08:23<KitaFox> And he is REALLY different.
15:08:27<KitaFox> Heh.
15:08:31<KitaFox> Okay... So...
15:08:57<KitaFox> Mega Man X takes place a 100+ years after the Dr. Light finished Mega Man X.
15:09:28<KitaFox> Mega Man X was built, because Mega Man died fighting Wily's last robot.
15:09:57<KitaFox> So... Wily is very much dead. So is Dr. Light. So is classic Mega Man.
15:10:42<KitaFox> Roll and Rush were long discarded for their archaism, because they refused to be upgraded after Mega Man died.
15:10:56<KitaFox> (This is all Word of God. None of this happens in any game.)
15:11:02<Laevos> ;w;
15:11:03<KitaFox> (The creators had to tell us.)
15:12:26<KitaFox> But yeah... Dr. Wily created a super, super powerful robot that went totally beserk and killed him, then went after Bass and Mega Man. Killed Bass AND Treble, Mega Man died when he defeated him. Some unknown entity retrieved the damaged Wily bot.
15:13:23<KitaFox> Mega Man was retrieved by Dr. Light, his personality chip and AI was analysed excessively, because Mega Man had been developing sapience... He already had a level of sentience, just couldn't feel.

15:19:31<KitaFox> So, Dr. Light created Mega Man X, and sealed him away, fearful of how humanity would be incapable of understanding the potential X had for good, and attempt to use him for evil, instead.
15:20:25<KitaFox> In fact. You should just watch "Day of Sigma."
15:21:01<KitaFox> There are some discrepancies between it and the series... But it is pretty much the Origin of X and the prequel to the first game.

15:40:41<KitaFox> X is also the best Mega Man.
15:40:55<KitaFox> Day of Sigma is really short.
15:41:01<KitaFox> Like... Half and hour or something.
15:41:19<Laevos> The bestest Megaman?
15:41:44<KitaFox> X is the best incarnation of Mega Man.
15:41:59<KitaFox> There are a bunch of different Mega Mans...
15:42:08<KitaFox> And some people say Zero is also a Mega Man.

16:17:29<KitaFox> He wasn't made by Dr. Light... and technically all other Mega Mans have been...
16:18:12<KitaFox> But he was made based off of an extremely advanced version of Mega Man Classic's AI and Personality chip... Very much like X was...
16:18:33<KitaFox> And is like... the prototype/brother of X, in a way...

00:21:14 KitaFox: misses chiptune music.
00:21:24<KitaFox> Like... Not that it is gone...
00:21:29<KitaFox> But the greats have left it.
00:23:23<KitaFox> It was such a limited format.
00:23:30<KitaFox> A true test of musical composition.
00:24:15<KitaFox> "If you can make shit that people will listen to, in this format, you are basically awesome at music composition, and should go make music in a less limited format."
00:24:18<KitaFox> The problem?
00:24:21<KitaFox> They all did that.
00:24:22<KitaFox> :<
00:26:19<Laevos> Aww
00:26:31<KitaFox> Like...
00:26:33<KitaFox> Pokemon.
00:26:40<KitaFox> Pokemon music is fucking fantastic.
00:27:14<KitaFox> Pokemon Gen I and Gen II would NOT have been as popular if the music had not been as good.
00:27:21<KitaFox> Kita believes this, wholeheartedly.
00:27:45<KitaFox> Fighting Lance and Red in GSC was so... Ominous.
00:28:00<KitaFox> Their theme was a dark turn for Pokemon music.
00:28:48<KitaFox> "This is the most powerful trainer you will have fought until this point. The Elite Four prior were all of equal strength to one another. This guy? At least a magnitude stronger. You're fucked."
00:28:56<KitaFox> And then Red...
00:29:58<KitaFox> "This is the most powerful trainer in all the games. The longer this battle drags on, the closer to defeat you shall be. End it quickly, or you will lose. You're super fucked."
00:30:08<KitaFox> Sets a tone.
00:30:09<KitaFox> A mood.
00:30:27<KitaFox> Sonic music is just so pretty, and themed and just... <3
00:30:38<Laevos> :3
00:30:43<KitaFox> Nothing feels out of place...
00:30:53<KitaFox> Mega Man music is whimsical and fun and so upbeat.
00:31:06<KitaFox> Seriously.
00:31:18<KitaFox> Chiptune music, nowadays, is boring.
00:31:44<KitaFox> One of the last great chiptune artists was Pixel, who made Cave Story.
00:35:06<KitaFox> The SNES Mega Man X games, too.
00:35:15<KitaFox> They had great music. Still chiptune.
00:35:22<KitaFox> Not pseudo-instruments yet...
00:35:26<Laevos> Oh well :ccc
00:35:41<KitaFox> Just... Good chiptune music is gone.
00:35:42<KitaFox> T^T
00:35:56<KitaFox> Lilith should try her hand at chiptunes!
00:36:17<Laevos> But then I'd be making music for others, not for me...
00:36:40 KitaFox: headtilts.
00:37:04<KitaFox> Not even to experiment with the format?
00:37:04 KitaFox: has dabbled in chiptunes, via Sleep is Death.
00:37:13<Laevos> Chiptunes aren't something I enjoy creating... I've tried it before
00:37:28<Laevos> it's not 1:1
00:37:44<Laevos> I don't get immediate instrument feedback with a tracker
00:37:45 KitaFox: nods.
00:37:48<KitaFox> Understandable.
00:38:12 KitaFox: just fiddles with things.
00:38:38 KitaFox: fiddles with Lilith.
00:38:38 KitaFox: pulls out a fiddle, and FIDDLES THE FIDDLING FIDDLE
00:39:11<Laevos> o bby
00:39:14<Laevos> Hehehehe xD
00:39:26<KitaFox> Violins are cool.
00:39:46<KitaFox> Fiddling would be a cool technique, if it could exit the fucking country sound.
00:39:59 KitaFox: drop tunes a fiddle.
00:40:13<Laevos> Pfft xD
00:40:30<Laevos> Aren't violins already tuned to fifths?
00:40:33<KitaFox> That could actually have interesting consequences!
00:40:42<KitaFox> And yeah. Suppose so.
00:40:50<KitaFox> DROP TUNE IT ANYWAY
00:40:54<KitaFox> OR
00:41:02<KitaFox> USE A BOW ON A GUITAR
00:41:12<Laevos> Now you're talking ;3
00:41:13 KitaFox: is just shouting random shit, now.
00:41:18<Laevos> too bad Kita doesn't like noise
00:41:24<Laevos> she'd be good at it ;w;
00:41:28<KitaFox> No.
00:41:31<KitaFox> Kita would not.
00:41:36<Laevos> to the extent that one can be 'good' at making random sounds
00:41:51<KitaFox> She would be good at providing ideas for people who could actually stand the noooooise.
00:43:00<Laevos> Fair enough xux
00:43:13<KitaFox> But yeah
00:43:18<KitaFox> You're welcome to try this shit.
00:43:20<KitaFox> X3
00:43:24<KitaFox> VIOLIN

00:43:56<Laevos> xux
00:44:11<KitaFox> Open up a chiptune-making program
00:44:24<KitaFox> And roll your face accross the keyboard.
00:45:24<KitaFox> Then
00:45:40<KitaFox> Layer it over itself in a different soundfont
00:45:51<Laevos> BACKWARDS
00:45:53<KitaFox> And then layer it over itself BACKWARDS in a third soundfot
00:45:56<KitaFox> soundfont*
00:45:59<Laevos> :33333
00:46:42<KitaFox> Record a vixen's scream...
00:46:52<KitaFox> And then remix it, like a shitty 00s bootleg.
00:47:13<KitaFox> With some like...
00:47:18<KitaFox> Underground
00:47:21<KitaFox> Noiserock
00:47:24<KitaFox> Or something.
00:48:08<KitaFox> IS THIS WORKING FOR YOU
00:48:11<Laevos> I love you xD
00:48:16<Laevos> YOU ARE THE BESR

00:48:47<Laevos> BESSER ALS ALLES
00:49:07<KitaFox> Take the battle move sound effects from Pokemon Red/Blue
00:49:30<KitaFox> And mix them with the battle move sound effects from Pokemon Black/White.

01:18:58<KitaFox> So yeah.

01:23:39<KitaFox> She has the puppy, and licking it.

01:26:23<KitaFox> This is not going to be a guard animal.

01:27:17<Laevos> Probably not xux
01:27:37<KitaFox> Though...
01:27:46<KitaFox> Kita is going to have to... assert dominance.

20:57:53<KitaFox> Ugh. Every fucking YouTube comments section for a Power Metal song is just...
20:58:03<KitaFox> Half "This member shouldn't have left... waaah"
20:58:05<Laevos> ;-;
20:58:22<KitaFox> And half "DragonForce sucks lol so produced, can't play live lol"
20:58:46<Laevos> can't play alive ;u;
20:59:07<KitaFox> DragonForce can play just fine, live.
21:00:55<Laevos> w/e u say bbly
21:01:05<KitaFox> They played just fine BEFORE Inhuman Rampage... They had an infamously bad show that was ruined by their soundguy fucking everything up.
21:01:17 KitaFox: has seen DForce live a few times, actually.
21:01:37<Laevos> It's no concern of mine whether they can play live or not ;u;
21:01:40<Laevos> I can't play live o:
21:01:45<KitaFox> X3
21:01:51<KitaFox> But yeah.
21:01:56<Laevos> this is partially because I can't play that many instruments at once
21:02:12<KitaFox> One of the most common complaints about DragonForce is that they can't recreate their album sound live.
21:02:24<KitaFox> Or that they slow it down for when they play live...
21:02:46<KitaFox> Or that they instrument sync.
21:02:52<KitaFox> Lipsync.
21:07:12<Laevos> Yeah, Lilith has heard all these accusations
21:07:24<Laevos> and whether they're true or false, they won't change her opinion on DragonForce ;w;
21:07:29<KitaFox> All of these are false.
21:08:12<Laevos> See above ;u;
21:08:18<KitaFox> Not trying to.
21:08:27<KitaFox> Just saying that people bitch about untrue shit.
21:08:36<Laevos> Yeah, they do
21:08:39<Laevos> it is the Internet :c
21:08:43<KitaFox> And it is untrue shit that defaces the name of a band who delivers what they promise.
21:09:00<KitaFox> And it is just unfair to DForce that they get judged for shit that isn't even true.
21:09:07<Laevos> Yeah :c
21:09:17<Laevos> They should be judged for the things that are actually wrong with them!
21:09:18<Laevos> :D
21:09:31<KitaFox> The Ultra Beatdown tour was good, when ZP was sober, and when they would start their first song.
21:09:54<KitaFox> By their third songs in some places, ZP would have chained his way to his sixth or seventh cigarette.
21:09:59<KitaFox> The lead singer.
21:10:00<KitaFox> Smoking.
21:10:11 KitaFox: rubs her temples.
21:10:11<Laevos> Good choice
21:10:19<Laevos> sure that helped him really nail those falsettos
21:10:32<KitaFox> It was good that ZP got his fucking reality check.
21:10:37<KitaFox> The band really sobered up.
21:10:42<KitaFox> Quit playing shows drunk.
21:13:25<KitaFox> The Power Within was a good tour.
21:13:35<Laevos> I'm glad Kita enjoyed it :3

21:22:17<KitaFox> Which is mediocre, by Kita's standards...
21:22:25<KitaFox> But a lot of people are excited about it.
21:22:51<Laevos> What about Maximum Oversatan?
21:23:04<Laevos> That's a band that Lilith knows only because she talks to people who run the label they're signed to
21:23:06<KitaFox> Maximum Oversatan?
21:23:08<Laevos> they don't seem like Lilith's thing
21:23:09<Laevos> yeah

21:55:10 Laevos: nods ;u;
21:55:41<KitaFox> First Gen's Pokerap was done FOR Kita, and will be used for call back reasons, and for setting the backbeat.
21:55:53<KitaFox> The rest of it will be all original.
21:55:56 Laevos: nods ;u;
21:56:06<Laevos> Will Kita be doing the pokerapping?
21:56:12<KitaFox> No.
21:56:15<Laevos> ;u;
21:56:16<Laevos> Who will?
21:56:22<KitaFox> Kita has a couple of friends who want to do it.

22:14:57<KitaFox> if Sam left DForce, the band would fail.
22:15:13<KitaFox> And DForce makes Kita happy. So Lilith doesn't want them to fail, does she?
22:15:51<Laevos> Noep xux
22:16:05 KitaFox: snickers.
22:18:14<KitaFox> Herman and Sam have a shit ton of technical skill.
22:18:43<KitaFox> Like, as far as guitarists go, they are top notch. Maybe not the best, but damn good.

00:21:18 KitaFox: is beginning to see a pattern, about people who play D&D being too new to the game and not seeing what the fucking game is about.
00:22:22<KitaFox> D&D used to have this HUGE barrier to entry, allowing for only the dedicated (over many hours of book-reading) or the more intelligent (with their ability to absorb lots of information and quickly) to play the game.
00:22:44<Laevos> Glad that's no longer the case :'3
00:22:55<KitaFox> Well
00:23:00<KitaFox> There is good AND bad with that!

00:25:45<KitaFox> Yes...
00:26:28<KitaFox> But campaigns have gotten more combat heavy in the community, because combat is easy to plan, and takes less writing skill or communicating skill to execute, as opposed to story-based campaigns.
00:27:20<Laevos> Yeah, I've literally never played a campaign that wasn't pretty much 100% combat driven in D&D
